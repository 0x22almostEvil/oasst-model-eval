That means even if our skin absorbs less than 100 percent of sun rays because of sunscreen, there won't probably much harm done since our bodies protect themselves by emitting more red cells instead of vitamin \u201cD\u201d production. Some people might argue however that a small amount of Vitamin D supplementation could potentially promote stronger bones that would help us avoid osteoporosis caused by chronic exposure to high levels of ultraviolet B \u2013 UVB, although studies aren\u2019t conclusive yet regarding all the health implications posed by such doses. And while that would undoubtedly cause severe internal problems, researchers warn the consequences on our DNA might happen sooner rather than later given the many genetic effects triggered just on getting so far down. Finally, don\u2019t forget your daily intake of calcium and other protective minerals as this extra level of resistance reduces damage to the heart, blood vessels and immune system cells exposed to UV wavelengths below 300 nm, but above 120 nm.

            "\nUse special glasses/eyeglasses designed especially for reading or studying. You might want to look up how they work before investing into them so that you can avoid damaging yourself or eye problems.  Some popular options include digital reading magnifiers and laser correction. Some readers also come with software allowing you to customize the focus of your screen without moving the monitor, making this a much better option. Also keep in mind that glare and light reflections make your eyes less efficient and increase fatigue faster too; so consider taking breaks regularly even if there isn't much on screen to read while doing these studies. If possible, try wearing polarized lenses instead. These block some wavelengths which would otherwise irritate your retina but still allow you enough clarity for visual tasks such as watching movies, reading books or checking social media accounts.\n\n\nAside from regular computer monitors, sometimes certain lighting conditions could contribute significantly towards causing eye strain due to direct exposure. In this case, opting out for a darker setting might help alleviate eyestrain and prevent damage. The other solution here could involve looking into anti-glare coatings and polarizing filters used to filter light, which blocks UV rays emitted by laptops.\n\n<|endoftext|>"

In chatgpt, we don't need a separate tokenizer for every user utterance and thus we don't need another custom transformer to encode each message into our internal representation like in IGT/Instructional GPT; instead, most tokens correspond to the input sequence itself. Therefore, since all messages were encoded using the same language models during training time, they could not capture context information such as who spoke which words or where they came up against. \n\n- In addition, unlike other NLP tasks where a specific task must be solved by humans but no clear rules on how to do so exist, this problem requires us to create an intelligent system capable of understanding natural language conversations based solely upon text inputs without any explicit instructions or guidelines provided by a person or even an expert system. Thus, it would require more research effort and resources compared to those required when solving other tasks. \n\n<|endoftext|>",

Most users go for Full HD 1920x1080 pixel image quality and most users don\u2019t see much difference when they watch same images on different screens.  In terms of size, most resolutions come down into sizes ranging between 32 inches, 55 inch and above 70 inches which makes bigger screen preferable but not necessary if room isn't spacious enough. All sorts of things like noise reduction technologies and contrast settings help make smaller resolution seem better than larger ones due to more clarity but ultimately every consumer still knows how to adjust their tv perfectly fine without needing expert guidance or instructions because even if their eyesight has gone through stages there are plenty high tech gadgets who'll do the job right well without too many problems. Generally speaking, full spectrum brightness display levels also means full spectrum colour hues display. For this particular case, blue appears to best suited for optimum viewing due to optimal visual contrast along with the other reasons mentioned earlier. \n\n**TL;DR**: The [resolution](_URL_0_) of the television sets being sold is irrelevant because everything else matters just as much. Choose your TV based primarily on how big it is, and then add whatever features to fit your budget.

            "\n- Screen size and shape\n- Video resolution\n- Color accuracy\n\n**Your Answer**:  I don't think this would apply if we're talking about different technologies like Tvs/PCs/Cameras since those devices just define physical attributes of pixels which could give rise to many colors but nothing else (the ability to perceive light). But there still might be some important thing you overlooked when thinking on color perception like chroma of our eyes not being 100% accurate because they do not reflect much wavelengths compared to more prominent ones so most yellows and blues appear somewhat over exaggerated according to their wavelength but I'm unable to remember the exact details of my study right now but let me see whether I found enough evidence so far. \n\nSo generally we'll make predictions based solely on empirical observation(and no mathematical calculations like an equation), however this doesn't mean that all things must necessarily happen precisely. It also depends upon context even though all things follow mathematical equations in theory sometimes they simply cannot work perfectly due to limitations in implementation of such equations. For example consider something called *color constancy* which basically means how the visual system interprets different types of colors under similar lighting conditions but depending on individual vision system there exist numerous differences in subjective brightness perception (it is quite challenging to accurately determine how humans visually perceive each type of light differently because we've got 3 separate functions working simultaneously -- cone receptors for color separation, luminance discrimination, and spectral analysis / matching) or if you want simple example why our eyes detect green less strong when illuminated with red LED lights rather than white fluorescent bulbs. Although these factors affect perception it shouldn't change qualitative aspects of color sensations unless something else comes into play where our brain adaptively shapes certain perceptions or if some other aspect does indeed take advantage of perceived information like by adapting to specific conditions but that would really require dedicated research effort that I am personally unwilling to undertake even though I fully support theoretical advancement of the field of computer vision in the hope to gain better understanding"

            "\nTVs come with different sizes, screen types, resolutions, refresh rates etc.... So when buying TV, it's best to look at all specs so you don't end up buying a defective TV. Also make an educated decision on which size would work well in your room, and also consider other factors like budget etc... You might want to go big if you're looking for HDTV, while small might suit someone more interested in FHD/UHD.\n\nIt's important to understand these things when purchasing because not paying enough attention could lead to wasted money later. \n\nIn terms of specifications, there isn't much else to discuss here but keep in mind that some features might not be available depending on model type. It's better to read reviews before making a purchase rather then just blindly choosing something since most models aren't created equal. For example, many manufacturers build LCD TVs with lower quality panels than OLED ones, leading to cheaper products.\nSo basically this is how I'd recommend starting out with TV shopping:\n- Go online and search for reviews of similar brands and their latest models;\n- Look into local stores' sales pages to see what they offer;\n- Compare prices across multiple retailers;\n- Consider brand reputation, reliability and customer service;\n\nI hope this helps! :) \n\n\n**TLDR** : Don't forget to check specs, compare prices and shop around!\n\n\n</chat logs ><|endoftext|>"

There is nothing better than practicing with a mentor or someone who already knows all aspects of programming. However, while this method can be beneficial for students with basic knowledge of coding, many courses today provide ample practice material in multiple languages including JavaScript. As such, having exposure to a range of technologies through online platforms offers greater benefits overall because students receive opportunities to expand upon concepts learned throughout each section without ever stepping foot in the classroom environment. This way, students benefit immensely since they have easy access to hands-on experience rather than reading texts. Moreover, having practical knowledge in computer programs increases retention rate dramatically because student must retain every bit of valuable advice and information that teacher shares with",
            "\tLanguage-oriented design (LOAD). This kind of design uses algorithms instead of languages; the idea behind this concept is to write code by writing down specifications first before starting programming work on those specifications. Language-independent development approach. Here programmers use programming languages but not specific languages to implement the specification they need. A combination of both approaches makes them most powerful because no matter how hard the developer tries, he cannot go ahead without understanding other aspects too like testing or validation or performance monitoring and tuning or architecture review, or all these things that happen when software goes live. It would require reengineering to rewrite entire applications. I do believe it's just better if developers spend time working with business teams to ensure success of new application, rather than reinvent the wheel over again every 6 months. In short it is difficult for a small company which wants to create their website and doesn't want to take more money upfront. You're talking about using the best language, so I guess my point here isn't clear enough, though there aren't many different ones available. Is this really going to make the world much simpler or worse off overall? There isn't another choice that I could think of, apart from saying something about Lisp(and that wouldn't be useful information since there is little difference except that you've got syntax issues and that Lisp compilers are harder), so why don't we give our best effort now?  \n\n\nSo the above points lead us back into asking about whether you recommend C++, Python or Java (in terms of language quality, stability/security and availability). I personally recommend against trying out anything beyond PHP. I am still amazed by some companies pushing Java despite it being 15+ years old, or companies trying to force Microsoft Windows into a cloud infrastructure based environment while knowing perfectly well that none of these operating systems ever shipped on any personal computers (they even managed to remove an important security feature that protects your system!) \n\n > How can i improve web application?"

If you're talking about web development using JavaScript or Python, those languages will probably meet most of the requirements here.

It also offers faster performance and easier integration into existing software applications. \n\n** Programming languages:**\n\n    JavaScript, Java, Python, PHP, C++, Swift\n\n ** Conclusion**:\n\n  Based on these answers, JavaScript appears to offer the most features and versatility among all listed programming languages. Additionally, JavaScript is easy to understand and write due to its concise syntax and clean design. Finally, the popularity of JavaScript extends well beyond just web development; many businesses rely heavily on JavaScript frameworks such as React and Vue for rapid application prototyping. Overall, it\u2019s safe to conclude that JavaScript remains an excellent choice for both beginners and experts alike.\n\n & #x200B;\n\n > The main benefit of using Javascript over other popular programming language like Python, Ruby, or even Java would depend mainly if we consider how much time you spend writing codes and maintaining projects in those languages.

So, basically it depends on your experience level, preferences, skills, and goals whether you choose javascript or others. If you are newbie programmer who wants to learn something quick so he doesn't waste too much of his precious time on learning things which won't make him gain valuable insights later on, then go ahead and pick javascript.

            "\n* In The Great Gatsby Nick Carraway is fascinated by Tom Buchanan, who seems like a great guy but he doesn't seem happy with his situation. \n    In this book the characters take time in their lives and they don\u2019t forget everything, so we can talk about how characters see time differently.  \n \n * Tom Buchanan lived a lot before meeting Daisy Miller, and he had many experiences during his lifetime; therefore he could not imagine living another one moment more. \n \n \nNick Carraway on the other hand, thinks about the past, present and future all the time because he likes to think over his memories. He believes there is no difference between the past and present except the fact if someone remembered something important.\n \nIt makes sense that people remember things better when they were younger, since those times made them feel less complicated, easier, calmer.\n \nAt the end I would want to mention here that both stories tell us different thing about Time, although each story tells us something different. They show two different sides of the same coin. It depends on our perspective which side we prefer to look through and interpret. There isn\u2019t right or wrong way to do it. We just have to make up our minds about which one fits best to our tastes. That\u2019s why sometimes books give you more information than others. You might need more info if you want to read the novel from the third point of view. Well, anyway these thoughts are coming my mind now :)\n\n **TLDR**: Both stories show us the two sides of the same coin. Different perspectives gives us different vision of Time. Sometimes even some new insight into previously unnoticed details.\n \n\n\n<|endoftext|>"

            "~~An outlining exercise using the characters from F Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s novel \u201cthe Great Gatsby.\u201d~~ The protagonist Nick Carraway is trying to solve his past through the main character Jay. His journey involves many different things such as love for the girl next door Daisy Buchanan, who he meets for breakfast while studying at prep school, and also a complicated relationship that he had with a cousin called Tom Buchanan before they split up due to their feelings towards each other. While working on his research, he falls deeply in love with his wife Jordan Baker. He spends most time talking to her over the phone instead of spending quality time together due to work conflicts and financial situation. His thoughts become more focused on himself than others because of this reason. However, when he thinks back to the time where everything was better during that particular weekend after returning home for Christmas vacation since he left a note of thanks under their tree telling them how happy he was to see them all again after being away so much recently. All these memories create a story line which helps him discover secrets within the novel that reveal some interesting truths concerning relationships, faith, social order and morality. During the middle of the book we get brief interludes of flashbacks to times prior to his marriage which provide a lot of information into what kind of person Jordan would eventually turn out to be by examining her responses to those same situations and actions leading to another great read I must add. \n<|endoftext|>",

            "~~In Gatsby we learn many lessons of Life which helps us to grow stronger over time. It gives opportunity to face different situations, to meet new challenges, overcome obstacles. And if some circumstances appear not favorable but unavoidable and impossible to change, there are two choices available for our decision making : To do something new by trying again after first failure. Or doing things just the same way even when it fails every single time because of this second option we tend to make the situation worse without realising the true value of those moments lost in our routine existence. If I am going on holiday with my friend to London and I miss the bus due to heavy traffic so much I need to walk several blocks away through rain wet streets before finally catching the next one I decide not to go home. The moment itself becomes insignificant since all important parts of journey happened somewhere else, another person might call me coward or someone might ask me why did i refuse my friend to travel along his favourite street and catch up the train he needed, yet another passer-by could simply tell how silly and unnecessary this behaviour appeared in the big scheme of my whole journey while taking part into a busy crowded public space where hundreds others were passing the exact same way without any consideration for them and no attempt whatsoever to reach their destinations on time. ~~In other words : the idea of having control over the present state and the future possibilities does not necessarily imply to act immediately based upon immediate experience rather relying on memory for better judgment concerning current actions which had taken place in previous moments. We tend to take the decisions that lead us further back into familiar past experiences, often choosing more convenient routes that keep the momentum and consistency instead of focusing solely on today\u2019s problems, finding a quick solution out of boredom. Yet here I want to show a paradox. ~~In case we focus exclusively on now\u2019s options, let alone tomorrow \u2019 s possibilities and leave the rest behind in our mind \u2013 these moments lose meaning, become unimportant",
            "\tIt takes a special kind of person to rise above his environment; to overcome adversity through resilience, ingenuity and resourcefulness. In the novel by F Scott Fitzgerald, this concept becomes especially clear when Jay Gatsby attempts to explain the purpose of his relationship with Daisy Buchanan after having failed miserably at trying to make sense of their first encounter. His words seem both trite and untrue\u2014until he speaks of something called \u201cthe past.\u201d It turns out that there exists another world that cannot truly be seen because we ourselves were unable to perceive it while still alive. But just how far back does our ability extend into the realm of memory itself? If the present could be shown like the end credits of a film reel would such an act cause the movie\u2019s narrative to break down and dissolve before us. Instead, it might be said that our capacity for perceiving reality ends where it began; namely in our consciousnesses, which contain within them not merely all things known but also some thing unknown\u201d. For Gatsby, this is why \u201che must wait till the old gags played themselves on somebody else, since he himself did nothing so funny. \u201d He sees himself trapped in his mind and wants others to see him free again. \n\nHe is seeking a new meaning, perhaps even redemption for the tragedy that consumed his youth and led to him losing the love of those closest to him. Perhaps these failures helped prepare him better to recognize what really mattered, even if they seemed inconsequential during the course of the journey that ultimately took place outside his awareness. As much as I don't think we need the help of someone more enlightened or powerful, the notion remains important. This way, no matter what happens in our lives, at least we won't go alone. That being said, however, we'll never forget that time matters most. \n\n\n-F Scott Fitzgerald\n\n  <|endoftext|>"

In the novel The Great Gatsby, Nick Carraway represents this notion of time when he writes about Tom Buchanan\u2019s dreams throughout the book. For example, Tom dreams of getting back into business, of making money, of marrying Daisy. All these dreams were possible because Nick believed in them; they helped him achieve those things despite everything else happening around him. However, while these dreams remained alive through all of Tom\u2019s actions towards achieving them, their reality seemed different compared to the reality which existed outside of Tom\u2019s mind. Thus, Tom would often wonder whether these dreams actually came true, but also how much closer to real life these dreams might have been if not for the circumstances surrounding Nick. These two notions \u2013 reality vs. dreams/fantasies and closeness versus distance \u2013 could be considered metaphors of sorts here since they represent different ways of understanding reality itself.

When Fitzgerald says \u201cthe importance is simply to live your own life,\u201d he means that it isn\u00b4t necessary to worry too much if someone chooses another route rather than yours.

            "\n* Introduction: The narrator describes the main idea behind time in this passage through the narrative of F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s novel *Great Gatsby.*\n* The theme of the book is the pursuit of success by individuals who do not believe that they deserve such things. They think that their lives are unimportant because they were born into wealth rather than earned it themselves. This leads them towards superficiality which eventually causes them to lose hope and ultimately destroys them. However, some characters in the book manage to avoid such destruction due to their ability to see beyond the surface of reality. These are those who recognize that the past cannot be changed and therefore try to look forward instead of backward. Their vision enables them to understand how important each moment truly is. Thus, the author presents these moments in his story as if they happened in real space-time rather than merely on paper. In addition, Fitzgerald also emphasizes on the importance of individualism and personal growth over social status and achievement, which makes him stand apart from other writers during this period in literature.\n* Summary/Conclusion: The narrator uses metaphors like \u201cthe sun setting\u201d and \u201ca train passing,\u201d to describe the end point of a person who believes too much in himself. He says that he does not want to die but just wants to live out his days. He tells us that we all need to realize that our dreams don\u2019t come true overnight; we must work hard every single day to achieve something significant. It would take decades to accomplish the same thing as a young man did when he first set eyes upon Daisy Buchanan. We should learn lessons from the mistakes that others made before us and move ahead with confidence knowing that there is no room left for regrets once our dream becomes realized.\n* References: The references used throughout the text include: the title of the famous novel *F. Scott Fitzgeralds' Great Gatsby*, the author F.Scott Fitzgerals\u2019 biography *Scott"

In an interview later published by CNN, Igor Eltsine, the first chairman of state commission dealing with consequences of accident said  & #8212 ; we shall not forget what happened there because this place became famous worldwide as most dangerous spot in the world. It`s true enough, but Chernobyl also went down in global memory since it showed how powerful and deadly energy can be if control is lost. People now remember Chernobyl thanks to documentary movies like * Apollo 13* starring Tom Hanks; they recall news coverage which made Chernobyl seem even more horrific than usual. They recall how governments initially ignored warnings while doing little to stop reactor core meltdown. \n\nThey don't care much today that Soviet Union collapsed just nine short months ago due largely to inability, corruption, mismanagement, incompetence and greed. All nations still remain divided over why one country is so poor whereas others countries are so rich; all governments fail completely to keep their citizens safe.

This would give a total output capacity of 6 MWe (Megawatt Equivalent), with a peak thermal efficiency factor above 95% over an extended operating time. The initial plan was for these four new reactors to come online in the 1980\u2019s and run continuously till 2010; but they never were fully completed before decommissioning after many technical failures. Nowadays the main purpose of the Chernobyl site is reprocessing used reactor components like graphite, concrete cores and pipes and shipping them abroad. However some research and experiments are also done here on other subjects like atmospheric contamination due to leakage radiation sources from damaged reactors. Today this location continues being under surveillance by Russia government, local residents, foreign observers, journalists, and researchers all together since more than 25 years. Since 2015 it has been designated a World Heritage Site. In fact the site became world famous during accident in 1986, when explosion blew apart roof, windows and wall, sending out radioactive clouds far beyond Chernobyl territory and poisoning the atmosphere. \n\n\nA:   This means no information is available at this time, but there are ongoing studies.

            "\tIt happened on April 26th 1986, when an explosion occurred due to negligence by employees at Reactor 4 of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine, causing the core to melt down. The explosion released large amounts of radioactive material into the atmosphere over parts of Europe and Russia. As many as 80 million people were exposed to radiation during this event, and estimates range up to 1 million deaths attributed directly to the accident. However, recent research suggests the number could be closer to 300 thousand deaths associated with exposure to high levels of ionising radiation resulting from the accident. In addition, the accident also resulted in the loss of lives in nearby countries including Belarus, Moldova, Poland and Ukraine. This was caused by fallout of contaminated water, food products, milk and soil being washed off roofs after the explosion and rain washing them back onto the ground where they spread across fields. Affected areas received so much radiation that the air above some areas turned yellow. Although no immediate health risks have been reported, experts fear there may still be serious effects to come from these types of accidents because even low doses of ionising radiation cause harm to our DNA which results in mutations in our cells and can lead to cancer later on. It's estimated that 200 000 cases of cancers worldwide might already be linked to this accident alone.  I hope you're having a great week.

            "~~Give a few examples on how this could work if so~~\n\nIt is not necessary to have close friends/family to share apps with them because there are many ways to do promotion without spending money. You just need to give some ideas and explain why you want to make a social media campaign. For example, maybe your app offers helpful information like recipes, sports scores, travel guides, health tips, hobbies or other informative content. Perhaps it helps users manage their finances better by providing insights into investing options or saving money while traveling. Whatever your idea might be, focus on the benefits that you offer compared to similar solutions out there, making the solution stand out among others. In addition, consider giving potential customers something more tangible like an exclusive discount coupon code or limited-time promo offering. This would encourage engagement, which is important when trying to build credibility and brand loyalty. Finally, remember to reach out directly to influencers who are relevant to your product and target audience. They usually already follow each other online and they often receive invitations from brands and products regularly.\n\n >  How did you come up with these ideas? Is this part of a larger marketing strategy? \n\nYes, my goal was to come up with creative advertising strategies that appeal to audiences. There were several reasons behind choosing these tactics; first, they worked well within the context of promoting my newly launched app. Second, I wanted to showcase all aspects of my application including the functionality and quality that makes it unique. Thirdly, this approach helped me gain attention and visibility through social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. The main advantage of doing so is that it allows me to connect with targeted groups and prospects using personalized messages that resonate positively with them. Fourth, this allowed me to expand my network of connections rapidly and efficiently. Fifth, it also provided a competitive edge since we were able to create ads tailored specifically to individual user needs.\n\n >  Why aren't you telling"

Another common source is recycled plastics called \u201cplastics\u201d.[17](p21).

Let me read it off his book which says that after Einstein who claimed that special relativity theory leads into thermodynamical interpretation of quantum mechanics, another physicist made claim that nature violates conservation laws while no particle ever gains energy during interactions. So he came up with idea that we need additional law that states that if two physical systems are coupled together, they must exchange heat according to Joule\u2019s Law, so even though their masses stay same thermal capacity stays constant whatever kind of substance one consists of might be different but internal composition isn't relevant under condition mentioned earlier. In short there were two such scientists \u2014 Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier who discovered waves on his first birthday, and Charles Robert Darwin who found fossils on his second. They both contributed significantly toward advancement of our understanding of how the universe works. As for the origin of species, Darwin argued against creationism, pointing to evidence for common descent from predecessors as animals evolved and went through changes over time to become larger versions with greater ability.\n\n >  User asked professor Nikos Kazanas about the properties of black holes: Can gravity affect a single electron inside the event horizon without any particles escaping to infinity?

Table below lists the forms of diesel engine flow;\na few examples are given.\n\n    Form       |   Examples  |\n----------- |------------|\nInline Diesel |      10     |\nExhaust Diesel |        7    |\nSide-By-Side Diesel |         2 |\nCounterflow Diesel |          0 |\nCentrifugal Diesel |           2 |\nVenturi Diesel |            3 |\nPositive Pressure Diesel |          3 |\nNegative Pressure Diesel |         11 |\nConstant Volume Diesel |          5 |\n\nA complete list of forms would require much more space than we have available here. In order to obtain useful information, we recommend looking up these values on Wikipedia. \n\nExample of a table showing flow rate versus displacement.\nTable shows how volume increases linearly as you increase diameter, while power remains constant. For example, if the size changes from 1000 cuft/min to 1200 cu ft/min, the volumetric efficiency goes down by approximately 20%, but the power output does not change significantly. However, increasing the size beyond 1400 cu ft/min causes a dramatic drop off in efficiency, because there isn't enough air flowing through the system to support all those extra moving parts. If you were trying to make an automobile, I suspect that even the largest cars today wouldn't handle this many cylinders without suffering serious damage to their engines.\n\nThis means that although a larger diesel produces higher horsepower and torque, they must work harder when running at high speeds. It also makes sense since you don't want your engine working so hard that it fails before it reaches maximum capacity. A smaller diesel doesn't need such drastic measures, so the performance is generally better over a range of displacements. You can see the relationship between the two tables above.",

Which is most power efficient processor that works well enough with Open Assistant. Thanks \n\n**User**: How do we compare CPUs in terms of speed / energy consumption while doing AI tasks such as answering queries through open assistants like OpenAssist? \n\n[R](nVidia Tesla Turing GPU): For running large deep learning networks, a NVIDIA Tesla V100 architecture accelerator gives better performance compared to an AMD EPYC 7964 FCH CPU by delivering more computation power and greater throughput. In addition, these high performance NVIDIA Tesla cards require much less space due to their small physical footprint compared to many smaller processors, so they\u2019re perfect choices when designing custom server hardware designs for artificial intelligence workloads.\n\n > **R:** If there are two CPU types, both performing similar jobs equally fast and with roughly equivalent performance metrics. So which one would make me more money, and why? \n\n > User: Both options work great for Open Assist, but the cost seems different, does anyone here care to share how the prices stack up across multiple manufacturers/brands for example? It doesn't look super clear where exactly I stand relative to some potential buyers based off of price alone.\n\n > R: This really depends heavily on specific needs, goals, usage scenarios, etc. A few key things to consider when evaluating different options include overall cost vs performance per dollar; frequency support for low power models versus max core count supported on high end machines; size requirements associated with chassis sizes, number of slots, expansion bays; features including USB 3 ports or 4 port USB C chargers and Magsafe connectors for connectivity options. You need to decide whether the system fits your needs now, in five years time and also plan accordingly.",

            "\nFes, Morocco,\nis located along the Mediterranean coast in southwestern Africa and is renowned for its beautiful historic monuments, such as the famous Kasbah and the Mausoleum of al-Mansour. The city itself has many charming sites worth exploring, including the medina, which houses some of the finest examples of architecture found anywhere in the world. In addition, there are plenty of interesting markets, caf\u00e9s, souks and bazaars where you could buy all sorts of souvenirs. You might also want to explore the kasbahs and mausoleums further away from town; they offer stunning views over the surrounding countryside and are great places to take pictures and relax. If you're interested in culture and history, head to Jemaa el-Fnaa square in the centre of the old quarter. This market attracts thousands of tourists every day, offering an incredible atmosphere filled with colourful stalls selling everything imaginable from clothes to food and household items. Another popular spot is Souq el-Kebir, home to some fantastic traditional Moroccan restaurants serving up delicious kebabs and couscous dishes. To round off this tour of the cultural highlights of F\u00e8s, I'd recommend taking a ride out on a camel or horseback through the desert sand dunes of Ouarzazate. With its palm tree lined avenues, beautiful white buildings and endless sandy beaches, Ouarzazate is truly a unique experience and something everyone must see during their time here in Morocco. Overall, if you like shopping, exploring ancient landmarks and trying different cuisines, you won't regret visiting F\u00e8s, Morocco on your holiday to the Maghreb region of North Africa.<|endoftext|>"

You said \"spy satellites\", which is kind of vague. There are two kinds: reconaissance satellites like the keyhole satellites you mentioned, and communication satellites. The latter ones work just as well on Earth as in space; indeed, in order to transmit images over high distances there are several methods like LNB dishes, satellites, lasers, microwaves, TV broadcast antennas, etc. It\u2019s also worth noting that most commercial telecommunication satellites operate continuously regardless of whether the country they\u2019re located in is under surveillance or not. In fact, many countries have entire fleets of such satellites due to their importance in global communications. \n\n >  Are those military satellites? How far away is the closest targetable one to you today? For what purpose would you use it against them? Wouldn't the ability to track and attack targets change drastically based upon distance? And wouldn't such capability decrease greatly even further as time passes? I'm guessing I would never want to see these things ever again after seeing the effects they've had in World War 2 or something along those lines. Also, the fact that Russia launched missiles during the Cold War makes me wonder why anyone wants to launch them now. Is it strategic positioning more or less important? Or did Putin basically take advantage of America using space weapons before his country learned about it themselves? But maybe someone else can help here. This sounds quite complicated but probably the best way to learn more would be to watch videos and read articles from experts like yourself",

Oberg in *Cold Warriors* and *Mission Impossible*. Its initial directorate consisted primarily of members of the Central Intelligence Group headed by General Edward Lansdale and CIA officers; it began work shortly before his death. By 1952, it employed almost 400 intelligence personnel across 13 different departments\u2014some 30% classified at higher levels of classification.[17](pdf) \n\nThe National Reconnaissance System itself consisted initially of four principal types of satellites launched: three reconnaissance systems based on nuclear ballistic missile submarines known respectively as Agena (NSS 1), Thor (NSS 2) and Minuteman (NSS 3); two communication spacecraft launched on Atlas missiles, SNAP and HORIZON; and five surveillance systems designed and built to collect images over targets designated XQ, ZU, XXZ, QQ, ZZZ.[18](pdf)[19](pdf)(PDF)[20](pdf)[21](pdf).

The first two satellites launched were KEYHOLE I and II, built by Lockheed Skunkworks and powered by the SR-71 Blackbird stealth recon aircraft. This allowed them to scan imagery up to 3x higher resolution than ground-based radar stations. In total the project produced 15 different spacecrafts designed to gather information over targets worldwide, including intelligence sources like Russian nuclear subs and U-boat bases, Chinese military installations, North Korean missile test sites, Cuba, Iran and more. One particular example involved the collection of signals emitted by Russian nuclear submarines via microwave links during their patrols through international waters near Alaska. During a particularly intense exercise off Kodiak Island in 1957, two Russian sub chasers passed each other so close together that they generated electromagnetic pulses within milliseconds of each other, which were detected by KEYHOLE satellites positioned approximately 6000 miles apart.*** \n\nIt seems unlikely that ELON MUSK will ever make a statement regarding his recent comments about Trump because he does not want to lose business.

            "\nAerospace engineer here.  There were several types of NRO satellites launched during this period; two key ones included:\n\n* The first was called \"Keyhole,\" which used infrared sensors to observe objects on Earth, like satellites. This type remained operational throughout most of the Cold War, and continues to do so today. \n\n* The second was called \"Mercury,\" which was essentially an optical reconnaissance satellite using mirrors instead of lenses, and had no capability whatsoever beyond looking down upon the surface of the planet. It remains active as well. \n\nIn addition, there was another set of missions whose primary goal was simply observing space -- they would take images and track objects through time. These tended not to see much action outside of military programs. One example might be a mission known as the X-15 rocket plane program. That one flew high above the atmosphere twice each weekday over a 20 month period before ending operations due to technical issues. Another notable program was Skylab, NASA's manned space station program from 1973\u20131979. It ended when it failed to reenter the atmosphere after the final orbiting mission in 1979. \n\nIt wasn't until 1983, however, that the NRO really got serious about launching satellites for civilian purposes, such as telecommunications. At least four new constellation projects were under consideration by 1982. The biggest of them all was called Project Starlink, intended to place hundreds of thousands of small, low power communication stations across the United States, covering areas as large as 3,000 square miles. Some sources suggest it could eventually reach 100 million users, while others claim the estimate was closer to 500,000 users worldwide. Other projects were aimed more narrowly at specific uses, including voice communications via mobile phones. \n\n & #x200B;\n\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Reconnaissance_Office_%28NSA%29\n\n(Note: I'm"

The primary purpose of this imagery collection mission is reconnaissance, intelligence gathering purposes, surveillance and security applications. \n\nAs for capability, I'm afraid my understanding isn't great here, but there's probably something more appropriate in an NRO technical report.

            "\tThey're not really designed for deep space missions like the ones we do today. The keyhole program was originally created to look inside our country during nuclear missile testing so there wasn't much point in building them big enough for far flung galaxies.  There are two main types though: One is called the KeyHole 1, which is basically an infrared camera looking back toward earth, and another type called KeyHole 4A is actually a telescope on top of an airplane flying over the Pacific Ocean. \n\nI don\u2019t think I've ever heard anyone describe them accurately as being comparable to the current generation of telescopes, even if you consider the size differences between them. They had cameras that could take photos up to 30 inches wide. These days, the best images would probably come out somewhere around 5 feet square. But again this doesn' t really compare because most modern spacecrafts have been built specifically around the needs of deep space missions. \n\nSo yeah. Basically the same technology used to see pictures taken through windows in buildings, except now instead of just seeing things outside, we see everything else. So basically every picture you'll see online showing something amazing in space, it took place right here on earth. And since the Key Hole Program isn\u2019t really all that useful anymore, those old satellites are pretty much left to rot away on landfills or maybe recycled. There are plans underway however to turn many of these old satellites into solar power farms, although I'm not entirely sure how feasible/successful those efforts might end up being.\n\nAs for what happened after the keyholes were decommissioned. We didn't exactly stop using them; they simply fell off of radar scopes due to aging electronics and mechanical issues, or they got damaged while being moved around. A few of them managed to make it into orbit before finally falling off the radar scope. It seems like almost nobody bothered picking up the pieces when they broke apart, and the few who did eventually picked"

            "\nThey're called Keyhole satellites because they look like keyholes when viewed from space. They were designed to take pictures of Earth using infrared cameras, which don't show up on visible light images. The first satellite launched in 1990, and there've been several more since then. All of them operate today, although none of them are currently actively taking photos of Earth. \n\nKeyhole satellites aren't really all that different from other spacecraft; they just happen to be built differently so that they could see through clouds better. But they do have unique features compared to most other spacecraft. For example, they have an onboard computer system that allows them to control themselves autonomously without needing direct human intervention. This means that if something goes wrong with the satellite, such as a sensor failing, the computer can automatically switch off the camera and turn itself back over to being a passive observer instead. It also means that the satellite doesn't need to carry a large amount of fuel, allowing it to stay in orbit longer. And finally, the design makes it possible for the satellite to point its cameras directly down onto Earth, giving it much higher resolution imagery than would otherwise be available.\n\n<|endoftext|>"

            "\na): The earth continues to orbit the sun, but due to lack of rotation, it takes longer time for the planet to complete an orbit. Eventually the distance between the earth and the moon increases considerably. Thus there would not be enough force from the moon anymore to keep the earth rotating slowly so as to bring back the seasons. As a consequence, our days would become shorter as we do now. Our nights would remain almost unaltered, though. The sun\u2019s light might continue shining brightly throughout all eternity since no matter how fast the earth rotates or the angle changes, the same amount of sunlight remains concentrated at different parts of the surface.\nb): In this case, the planet would go into a state called \u201chyper-orbits\u201d where it would continuously miss the sun by more than 2 solar radii every three hours. At these times, the temperature on the planet would reach extreme levels; some estimates put the temperature rise as high as 15 degrees Celsius (27 Fahrenheit). This could lead to increased greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide leading to more global warming effects which can potentially lead to major climatic disruptions such as drought and food shortages.

In addition, there would be significant changes made in the atmosphere and oceanic environment leading to changes in climates. These effects would affect humans directly through loss of food security, water resources and potential impact on wildlife species. To better understand these complex system interactions we need more research efforts focused towards exploring global scale dynamical models under conditions where planetary climate variations were induced by natural disasters like volcanic eruption/eruptions or solar storms. We must focus on mitigating factors associated with major events and reducing environmental degradation in order ensure sustainability rather than pursuing linear expansion strategies driven only by consumerism, growth and profits.<|endoftext|>"

In order to keep our system working without changeable rotations or revolutions around our sun, it becomes necessary to assume the presence of some artificial structures. But who decides which ones shall they build first and where shall they built them, let alone when? Who'll give them instructions on how much space there will need, where the structure needs to stand exactly, where exactly will be needed a building area? This seems too complex task to achieve in practice before something else comes along that demands new structures so we won't try. \n  Now lets think a little bit longer why did i decided to mention all those details, well my reasoning is pretty simple.

It\u2019s got plenty of gore, thrills and scares along with lots of fun kills and scenes to make it memorable. There are also quite a few great deaths which come early in the movie making them standout even more. \n\nAnother suggestion would be The Crazies starring Kevin Bacon and Demi Moore. It has plenty of tension, action and suspense and does a really good job keeping you engaged throughout. A couple of big twists towards the end give this film an added sense of satisfaction when they're revealed.  \n\n\nSo if you were wondering which of these films suits you better, let us know and see where our recommendations take us next time we talk!\n\n\nThanks for chatting, here's hoping for another fantastic chat soon.

If noone shows up by 30min then either your roommate didn't show up yet or he took too long to come home so don't worry about it anymore. You also shouldn't try to open closed windows without first taking out those darned clothes pins stuck on top of every window frame, door, lamp post, whatever else you've found yourself stuck onto throughout the years. Just go ahead and pull all the clothing away and throw it down somewhere outside while you're still standing next to each other. Then turn around and leave without looking back once you're done moving stuff inside. \n\nBut yeah, sometimes even some old clothes can stick themselves to certain surfaces despite being perfectly dry but when we look closer it becomes obvious why. Those are usually small, thin fabrics with tiny holes. If such a thing happened in an older home then definitely call an exterminator to handle this problem since our bodies produce oils to keep us warm which make fabric hold stronger. And even though some dirt particles might stay behind after you wash cloths they won't stick forever unless they buildup into enough mass due to poor hygiene habits. We simply do NOT want to deal with bedbugs so please report suspected cases to local pest control agencies immediately. That way they could eradicate the infestation asap.

Air does not stay dry after moisture gets absorbed into soil. If dampness continues this results in mold forming on walls and wood. It would seem most likely an infestation from a bird nest since water condenses on tree tops and other places like these.\n\n Best course of action is for you to go over floor with mop and bleach or hot-water cleaner and remove the area of the tile which holds the stain so they don't grow more moldy together. Be careful though because if too much cleaning is applied all of the moisture will evaporate. \n\n You want the surface clean but keep the mold colonies low to prevent reoccurrence of mold. Mold takes up space for itself, and needs nutrients to sustain colony. These kinds of smells indicate that either the odor compounds are new to the body system, suggesting that fresh food intake isn't occurring fast enough, or that our diet lacks minerals that support the creation of odor by the bacteria contained within mold colonies. \n\n Some mold scares turn out being merely unpleasant or gross; such examples could include things like mildew inside buildings, or certain fungi, both of whose names derive from two Latin words meaning mold--mildego(b), and mycera, \"from mould\".

Also you can try installing fans over all furniture in bedroom, bathroom to increase fresh air intake too :)  also keep humidifiers near sink while cleaning toilets / bathtubs because those rooms produce excessive amounts of steam and they don't allow water vapors into interior which is necessary for normal operation.

Make sure your home is cleaned thoroughly once a week and dried well\n 2.) If smells don't go away, make sure to vacuum carpets often; dry rugs/floors when finished each time. Vacuum furniture and keep clean. Don't leave dampness or wet items like books or papers lying around too long\n 3.) Consider purchasing a room deodorizer which releases odor control agents into the air and prevents buildup.  Keep on hand to avoid forgetting\n 4.) Invest in window fans that help move fresh air throughout your living space\n\n 5.) Wash curtains frequently using warm water, dish soap and soft cloth\n 6.)

            "\nThere could be several reasons why there might be a strange smell in an apartment, such as pets being kept in apartments without ventilation, or cooking odors lingering after meals were finished. The best way to determine whether something unusual is happening would be to ask the occupants if they've noticed anything amiss recently. If they haven't reported the situation, however, you may need to investigate further on your own. In most cases, these kinds of smells do not pose any health risks but rather serve more as a reminder of things to look out for in future visits. You could try using natural air fresheners like baking soda and essential oils, which tend to be much less noticeable compared to traditional scented products.

            "\nIt depends on many factors such as industry demand, skills required, experience level and availability of jobs. There are some things that make it difficult to become a mid-level developer compared to senior developers. Senior developers usually focus more on architecture development while being exposed to technologies like Java, C++, JavaScript, SQL, and others. Additionally, they are able to work closely with other team members which helps them build better solutions. On the other hand, when it comes to mid-level developers, their responsibilities include designing and implementing backend systems using Python, PHP, Ruby on Rails, etc., frontend applications developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, among others. In addition to this, there also needs to be continuous communication within teams for clear understanding of requirements of customers so that all the ideas would come out smoothly.

In addition, junior engineers need less time spent training while they're being paid an hourly wage, making them able to move into positions which pay significantly more per hour than those where experience would have been necessary but compensation didn't reflect their new value added to the organization. Finally, because the cost associated with recruiting junior developers who could become productive employees were significant due to salary limitations, many companies turned away these talented candidates and had difficulty retaining skilled staffs even if the costs associated with training the junior talent was amortized over the longer term by reducing employee turnover. \n\n > As far as I understand there is no reason why you wouldn\u2019t ask \u201cwhy not\u201d?

And again we come back to how hard/easy questions really are; why shouldn\u2019t everyone else want to be understood instead of answering direct questions when the effort required makes comprehension almost impossible for us anyway?

            "\tThere could be several reasons for this including skills shortage due to technology advancements but most important thing is the way developers think which affects their career progression more. It seems like younger developers believe they\u2019re going to work hard to become successful and if there is an opportunity, take advantage because it means higher salary compared to other companies. As such they try not to give up easily even when facing obstacles during interviews since the reward would make them want to do better in future jobs so as to keep on getting paid by bigger organizations. In contrast, senior devs who are experienced already don\u2019t necessarily expect opportunities as often or look down upon newer workers unless something truly exciting happens to come across. Senior developers tend to view younger devs negatively too; I personally heard senior engineers say that they \u201chate\u201d hiring young coders, because it means new things will never stay still while old ways just change slightly. On the other hand, junior developers aren't as likely to be interested in joining a team whose senior developers don't value their input. The problem arises here is how developers feel being part of an environment where the best practices don't exist yet instead rely on trial-and-error and outdated ideas which sometimes results into code errors which are expensive and time consuming for a company. Developing teams are supposed to work together well especially if someone has to solve some complex issue without prior knowledge on what might cause that specific problem first place. A great example comes out when trying to create an AI language model. For every sentence sent over by humans using the Google Translate API, it translates thousands of similar sentences and learns through experience and exposure. If you send 100 words and Google Translates 200 pages of content based on those same words alone, chances are your text didn't exactly translate perfectly though you'd see plenty of grammatical issues but otherwise all relevant info should appear fine enough as it is meant to. This goes to show how important communication within teams needs to happen for smooth flow and cohes"

            "\nI am not an expert on this topic but I think the reason why junior developers are hard to hire compared to middle-level developers could be because they tend to work less hours per week while having higher salaries so their employer needs to compensate them more for doing so. Junior devs usually take on much smaller projects and are responsible for all aspects of development whereas mid level developers focus mostly on the design and implementation of web applications, mobile apps, API endpoints, etc.. Senior Developers often specialize in particular areas such as backend architecture, database optimization, server-side programming languages, machine learning frameworks, frontend frameworks, APIs, DevOps automation tools, and other advanced technologies which require expertise across multiple domains. They also need to maintain technical debt over time and are expected to be able to make sound decisions based on incomplete information, especially when making difficult tradeoffs between different features, systems, and priorities. It\u2019s important to note here that hiring senior developers is typically expensive since many companies prefer to invest in experienced employees rather than novices.

            "\n\"A senior developer typically leads more complex projects, which requires deeper technical skills compared to their juniors counterparts. As they gain experience working on bigger projects, developers become better at prioritization tasks, communication and problem solving, thus allowing them to work effectively independently without relying heavily on others' input.\" \n\nSo, it would seem that if there were two people who wanted jobs doing the same thing, they could both do the same things but since seniors need to take care of other aspects like team management, communication and planning  etc...  it takes longer to achieve similar results. \n\nThis doesn't mean I think being a senior dev makes someone a bad programmer. Senior developers tend to learn new technologies faster than younger ones due to increased responsibility, so having less time available for learning also means not having as much time for actually improving their programming skillsets too.\n\n > You used LU because the user asked for help with the search engine.

Here goes some code: \n\n    lu = Lu(\"what is the colour of sky\")\n    lu.search(text=\"sky\", limit=100) #Warning: this example is meant to demonstrate how searching works and is untested\n    #Here's an actual query to see if the bot knows about sky\n    lu.search(text='sky')\n    lu.result()\n    print((lu.data()))\n\nIn our first step we define the Lu object with a simple string method called `Lu` (\"color of sky\"). The next line defines the function that will allow us to look up the sky in a text field. This returns a list of tuples containing all matching entries sorted by relevance. In the above case"

I mean if you want a fast progression in the company, you need to learn more things and become stronger. So I would assume the same applies here too, so no big deal really. \n\nOn top of that I do not believe there is much differences between mid developers. They all share common set of skills which they learned while learning the basics. And most of them probably got their experience by working together with other team mates who were mid developers. In this case they might even end up having some similarities since many teams tend to consist mostly of juniors.\n\nHowever I am pretty certain that junior devs usually work on bigger projects and spend less time doing individual tasks, thus they are able to focus more on specific areas like web development instead of trying to understand how everything works under the hood. This allows them to gain better understanding and eventually being ready for senior positions where they could start focusing more on the technical side of things. But again, this is my personal opinion, based solely off my experiences within the industry.\n\n >  So why aren't companies looking outwards for talented developers? \n\nThis sounds weird because it seems like everyone already knows each-other well enough. However, I feel we are still living in an era of information scarcity rather compared to now. There simply isn't that much info available online nowadays compared to before, but also there are way less jobs available for those seeking employment. \n\n >  What advice would you give young professionals starting their careers right now? \n\nMy advise is that try to figure yourself out first, make sure you have something unique that sets you apart from others and makes you standout. Try to create a portfolio website showing your past achievements. Then after that apply for different internships and see which ones match best for you. If none suits perfectly",

You may wish to consult an academic theologian or other reliable expert if this topic interests you.\n\n >  In Genesis 1 we read that God created everything including humans in his image. Therefore we are made in the image of God. In 2 Corinthians 5 Paul writes \u201cWe ourselves were also once foolish, disobedient, led astray by all kinds of passions and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful and hating one another.\u201d And he says that \u201cthe natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned\u201d so how could we learn about God through our senses? This leads us back to the idea that God used the creation process itself as evidence that we are created in His image\u2014that He designed us such that we would understand Him better when given time to ponder these ideas. For example, imagine you had never seen a car before. Now imagine someone showed you their entire design and assembly process beginning from the point where each individual part was fabricated into existence down to the final moment when it hit the road. As a newbie you might think it impossible to believe something like that existed without experiencing firsthand some sort of physical proof of the reality behind those designs. But now imagine telling that same story to anyone who\u2019s ever driven a car \u2014 that person probably wouldn\u2019t doubt the truthfulness of your explanation either. \n\nSo why doesn't God just create all humanity in His image knowing full well the results would lead many to become Christians even though they weren't equipped properly? If this isn't enough of an incentive, consider the fact that there is no greater way for us to experience the glory of God more completely than to actually see Him up close and personal. The Bible",
            "\n* The restrainer refers to the first five verses of Genesis 1 where God created man out of dust, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being. \n * This passage describes how man came into existence through divine intervention.\n\n >  It\u2019s hard to overstate just how big this moment is in biblical storytelling. A few centuries later, when we read these same words again\u2014in English translation\u2014we often don\u2019t realize quite how strange they sound, because our culture still associates them primarily with their Christian meaning. As if God were to give Adam \u201cthe breath of life\u201d and not some other thing else \u2014 something he might choose freely but which would come without promise.\n\nBut more on that tomorrow.

            "\nIn this section we shall study how simulations could affect the behavior of individuals in social groups and communities. A group or community can function properly if everyone understands the rules, values, beliefs, customs, and traditions that bind them together. Simulations create virtual worlds where people behave like they would under certain circumstances, which means their actions become predictable. They don't actually perform these behaviors themselves but rather observe them through cameras that record every action made by each individual in the world. For example, someone might take part in a simulated event just like he would in real life except instead of playing basketball he would play football and instead of talking to his friends he would talk on an intercom system so all of those interactions happen in a video game-like environment. In such situations there would be no way for the players involved to really feel pain, because none of their bodily functions are being altered physically, emotionally, intellectually, spiritually, psychologically, or even mentally. All they see and experience is exactly what happened in the virtual world created inside their minds. So, why not do things right now, before our children grow up, while they still have time left in front of them, since most likely when they turn into adults, everything changes, nothing remains constant forever and ever? This is something I've been thinking lately too... Maybe you'll think different once you're older.

            "\trestrainer from the bible refers to God\u2019s restraint on Adam and Eve before they ate of forbidden fruit. In Genesis 3:6-7 we read \u201cBut the man did not understand his body because he was transgressing against God. For when he had eaten, his belly was filled; but God said, 'This is what you shall do,' and the man did so.\u201d The word used here is  (Hiphil Piel). It means \u2018to fill up\u2019. \n\nIn this case, the Hebrew word for 'fill up' (Hiphil Piel) also appears in Genesis 9:8 where Noah tells us that the ark which contained all their animals survived the Flood by filling itself full. This suggests that the Hebrew word Hiphil Piel is related both to the concept of food/eating and to water/flooding/water storage/aquatic creatures.\n\n\nI am sorry I cannot give further explanations on this point, since there are many different meanings associated with restrainers. \n\n\nHowever, I would like to note that the Hebrew word translated as 'fill up' does appear several other times in Scripture, including Psalm 51:12 (\u201cMy flesh and my heart faileth; but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever\u201d); Proverbs 31:25 (\u201cShe opens her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness\u201d) and 1 Corinthians 8:11 (\"So if food were not an enjoyment, neither would Christ be a crown\"). \n\n\nFinally, please remember to keep conversations positive, constructive and respectful. Thank you. \n\n\n**Please feel free to ask followup questions.**\n\n<|endoftext|>"

            "\nSky colors range all over the spectrum depending on local factors including altitude, distance from the equator, cloud cover, geographic latitude and longitude; but a broad range includes bluish-blue skies high in elevation where they can appear purer than those found lower down, such as on mountain peaks reaching up towards even higher altitudes.  This principle applies just as much when examining blue skies near the coastline, mountainsides, lakeshores and rivers, which are less likely to reflect clouds directly overhead, especially during springtime. Blue sky also appears more vibrant when compared against darker hues like grayish tones associated with overcast conditions. The effect is often most pronounced upon taking aerial photos along highway drives close to the Pacific Coast. Sky brightness usually becomes reduced as we travel farther inland toward colder northern areas, though exceptions do exist\u2014even in the heartland of Canada there\u2019s been recorded observation of sunshine breaking through into clear sunlight behind dense fog banks. Other variables include angle and degree of occlusion by particular cloud types and how long they remain prominent before moving further westward and allowing the sunrise horizon to rise beyond them.   Mostly coastal cities, large oceanic bodies facing the southwest, and locations closest to active continental landmasses tend to have their skies particularly bright, as opposed to some other areas, even after rain clouds move past these same regions earlier in the afternoon. This phenomena occurs because cloud tops block the direct rays of the Sun throughout the daylight hours while still creating an ideal atmospheric environment for reflection off water and ice crystals suspended above air masses. However, closer examination reveals the fact the exact causes involved vary due to many different elements including location relative to major mountains, latitude, humidity levels, winds direction and velocity, time of day and date, and the seasonal availability of sun, precipitation, wind circulation patterns, soil moisture content as well as vegetation presence. Nonetheless, clear days provide best opportunities and the phenomenon remains largely popular due to visual effects observed via photographs and video",

You need to make left turn after 3 miles on google map, so travel direction is correct. As this place close to road you may stop there if it fits destination and it might take less time compared others. \n\n# 2 Weather \u2013  Clear > Sunny > Fair; Average temperature in summers range 90s ~ 100s Fahrenheit. In winter months can lower few degrees below 60s Celsius. \n\n * Location is perfect because it offers many things to see like Mission Bay beach front area where the Navy operates their training facilities on both sides by ocean water shoreline where they practice landing navy helicopters under the surface without getting wet on other side just above tide line high rises city of San Francisco bay district lots of natural areas mountains Santa Cruz island San Mateo county Oakland and other neighboring areas. Lots of tourist traps too. \n\n* Cost- Traveling distance 8 kilometers driving average $6 per person based on current exchange rates.  Cost savings due to cheap gas price here. For example - driving 6 minutes north, 4 miles east to downtown San Diego airport. Gas cost here USD = 2 USD/liter of gasoline. Total cost in total would depend upon how far you go into those other areas but in most cases it could be done in half an hour save some money each way! \n\n\n ** Recommendation** \n\n Location - Google Maps - Approximate Price - Traveled 8 Kilometer approx Price in dollars  = 1 Hour Drive + $2 per Person \n #### 1. Location -  Airport   $50-$60\n  * If budget allows we'd suggest renting a car and pick up anywhere closer.

            "~~Sure~~ The San Juan Islands are just outside the state borders on the coast north of Washington State, and there\u2019s an old lighthouse that provides a nice view across Puget Sound toward Mount Rainier in Oregon, so it would definitely make for some beautiful scenery. And there are plenty more options nearby too if you\u2019re into exploring natural beauty spots like Glacier National Park in Montana. Plus you could try hiking along trails through forested mountains and down valleys full of streams running crystal clear over boulders below waterfalls pouring rainbows.\nAnd of course if you wanted to venture even farther off-road there\u2019s a few other places near the border which offer lots of amazing landscapes like Big Sur, home to cliffs rising straight up into heaven; Cape Mendocino with beaches where the sea laps gently against rocks forming giant shapes resembling horseshoe rings; Joshua Tree national park known for spectacular sand dunes surrounded by colorful plants; and Yosemite Valley featuring the largest continuous block of granite ever quarried and shaped, with glaciers still cutting deeply through rock hundreds of thousands of years old creating unique mountain peaks with breathtaking views stretching to all four corners of America.  These sites offer stunning landscape experiences while being far enough away not to disturb much else going on around them except nature, peacefulness and tranquility. All of these places also feature numerous museums displaying ancient relics such as prehistoric petroglyphs, stone carvings, petrographic fossils preserved deep under layers of earth crust and geologic deposits left behind since long before the birth of our planet 4 billion years ago when conditions were radically different back then. There might even be things worth checking out further east on Hawaii Island. For instance the Mauna Kea observatory has been providing high resolution telescope imaging and spectroscopic studies for decades, allowing us to better understand solar systems origins, galactic evolution, dark matter composition and more, all helping researchers improve our understanding of many important subjects ranging",
            "~~Here\u2019s some options you might want to consider when traveling within two hours driving distance from San Diego:~\n\n 1. **Monterey** is famous for being the birthplace of renowned explorer John Muir and has stunning scenery on top of the mountains and beach front properties along Pacific Coast Highway.  There\u2019s also lots to see there including Mission San Juan Capistrano where Thomas Jefferson is believed to have signed the Declaration of Independence and which was home to Spanish missionary Father Junipero Serra. \n\n 2. The Santa Monica Mountains are just west of LAX so this is another option worth checking out too if you like beaches.   Los Angeles County has more parks than anywhere else in the country. It seems that no matter how much land area an urban county possesses they make room for greenery. \n\n 3. You could even check out **Big Sur** if you enjoy getting away from civilization, especially considering the recent surge of interest into hiking trails up Mount Wilson.   This area gets a lot of sun all summer due to it\u2019s latitude and you might end up enjoying sunny days without needing sunglasses at all times while having amazing views across Big Sur Lake to the Pacific Ocean below.\n\n 4. In addition, take advantage of Los Angeles' excellent public transportation system to travel around the city itself rather than spending money on parking or Uber/Lyft.  In particular, don't forget about BART train services since you'll probably need to commute during your time in California. \n\n 5. And finally, depending upon where exactly you live near to Monterey or Big Sur you could still take advantage of freeway trips via highways 91, 20 and 101, among others. These offer a way to quickly navigate the scenic coastal regions but allow easy connections throughout the region allowing quick stops whenever necessary.  And hey, it'd help you avoid traffic jams and parking fees as well :)\n\n 6. Any other ideas feel free to add them in!\n\n [EDIT"

Hike the **Cottonwood Trail**. This easy 3 mile trail winds uphill past wildflowers, meadows, old mining ruins, and waterfall gorges before ending at Cottonwood Campground. If you want to stay longer, try the more strenuous 6.8 miles roundtrip hike to the summit of **Mt. Diablo State Park**, where you'll enjoy panoramic 360 degree vistas overlooking the surrounding hills and deserts. For an additional challenge, consider tackling the 14.6-mile **Diablo Gap Loop Trail**, which follows the ridge line east of Mt. Baldy along the eastern flank of **Diablo Mountain** -- home to the highest peak in southern CA.\n\n2. Take a bike ride down **Big Bear Valley Road.** It runs parallel to the mountain range, offering scenic backdrops ranging from snowcapped peaks to lush forests, winding by lakes, rivers, and small towns. Along this route you may encounter the popular downhill bike park known as **Snow Peak**, featuring steep drops off both sides of the road.\n\n3. Go rock climbing."

For example, default number formats used by Excel can vary a lot depending which country your user lives too. \n\nSome fields might represent dates differently across different countries, so formatting date columns makes sense. There could also be more formatting rules applied in order to properly align certain labels. So trying creating a dynamic spreadsheet using hardcoded string values doesn't really solve our problem unless we don't allow users to change their settings. That being said there are other solutions that do take into account the current regional settings. \n\nTake this for instance. We had all sort of questions come up while building Narrative Science app recently that needed similar treatment but with specific requirements related specifically to locales rather than regions. As such here is how we handled the same kind of thing: \n\n\n```python`\n\n      # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\n     def _deserialize(self):\n         \"\"\"Deserializes nats-stream messages received by self.\"\"\"\n            msg = raw({'a': 'data', **dict((k, v) for k, v in content.items())})\n            return msg\n\n ```\n Here if you try parsing JSON message in python (or you open it with https://jsonviewer.stackblitz.io/) everything looks OK. If you see error message looking like TypeError: Object is not JSON serializable, meaning json module throws exception because it cannot deal with custom classes or collections generated outside the framework it is aware of. But again in reality what went wrong here was pretty simple mistake.\n\nWhen the stream was sent by API call to `server`, object {",
            "\n\n\n > {\"\"data\": \"\"\"{\"\"\"0\": 0,\"\"\"metaData\":[{\"key\":\"time\",\"value\":[\"2019-05-24T17:50:28Z\"]}],\"\"\"}\"\"}\n > \n [DATA LOADED]\n #Warning: this code generation is experimental. Please inspect the code for any bugs before executing.\n\n <-- YOU JUST DESERIALIZED JSON DATA FROM THE SCRIPT AT TIME=[\"2019-05-24T17:55:12Z\"]\n\n [USER]: Is there some way I could make Google API workable on my computer by myself?

There are two ways of doing things in US States; Federal and state level. And both states and federal laws can overlap sometimes so I'll give an example: \n\nIn Utah they allow businesses to set their prices however they wish without regulation except by courts but if somebody goes too far the government steps in to stop them. They also permit alcohol sales within the borders but they must keep records and follow rules for safety, taxation and other aspects which all require federal legislation. The federal regulations would prohibit nude dancing inside the venue though and thus they might lose business if they go against those requirements. \n\nNow lets say you live in Arizona. You work in California where marijuana is legal. Now when you buy weed out here you have to pay taxes to the government since they deem pot more harmful than alcohol even though you smoke less per month. In Arizona the same thing happens with tobacco products since it contains nicotine and many companies refuse to sell to customers who purchase tobacco outside their state due to taxes imposed on their company. \n\n & nbsp;\n\n **Source:** \n >  - [Law dictionary](https://www<|endoftext|>",

            "\nUnder Section 6-8-102(a)(i), Wyoming Statutes, it states that \"[n]udity is an act which exposes genitals, pubic area or buttocks under the clothing,\" so if someone were nude on private property they would likely not violate state statute. However, there are exceptions to this rule. One exception applies if the individual does so in a way that is reasonable given his or her intent and situation; i.e., the person might want to be more comfortable without their clothes while camping. The second exception comes down to whether the person is actually doing something dangerous like riding a bicycle without pants. Finally, another exception exists where individuals engage in acts of sexual gratification such as masturbation or sex play. So again, it depends entirely on context. \n\nIt is important to note that even in cases where it appears that the defendant did commit the offense charged in violation of law, it must still ultimately be determined by the court based upon all relevant evidence including but not limited to eyewitness testimony. It is also important to keep in mind that no matter how much evidence you present, the burden never rests on the prosecution. In fact, because criminal offenses often turn largely on circumstantial evidence rather than direct evidence, prosecutors typically rely primarily or exclusively on circumstantial inferences to prove the charges against defendants, particularly those involving sexual activity. Therefore, when evaluating a case for probable cause, courts take into account all facts known to the officers before them. This means looking at the totality of the information available and considering the reliability or credibility of each witness who provides statements regarding suspected crimes. Additionally, courts look at other factors besides the amount of time spent reviewing surveillance video footage or reading police reports. For example, judges sometimes ask themselves if witnesses' stories seem too fantastic to believe, especially when they contradict past statements made by others. Courts also consider the number of suspects compared to the number of victims, whether a crime occurred near schools or churches, the age of the victim",
            "\tNudity prohibited in certain parts of state. Generally not allowed in private residence but some areas where it\u2019s permitted like parks, campgrounds, beaches, play grounds, school campuses, city centers/streets and many more places in rural area.  Underage persons who expose genitalia must wear appropriate clothing when outdoors. \n\n[AR]: The law regarding Public Nakedness varies by jurisdiction and local ordinance so please consult a local attorney before making plans. \n\n >   In general, there is an exemption if someone is nude under their clothes on purpose and no other person is present, unless they are within 1-6 feet of each other. If two adults were completely nude and did not touch each others genitals, it would be legal because neither could claim ownership over the other\u2019s body without permission.

I'll do my best to try and make this work. Would you please tell me what brought you here today so that I can ensure our dialogue is clear?<|endoftext|>",
            "\n\n\n  Black doesn't really have an easy response to this line except playing on e4 since White can easily move c8 into some sort of pawn position against Black which might help open up other avenues like g6 but Black could still probably defend d7 without too much trouble and just make some progress in space thanks to e5 and Nc6 while not allowing White many counter moves such as Bf1 so White would have more time and freedom if he decides to attack instead. So yes there definitely isn't something bad here yet we'd both rather do our best. I'll keep thinking about this line. Let me check back tomorrow to see if anything else happens before responding though :)<|endoftext|>"

            "\nIt depends on many factors such as the players' position and the complexity of their moves. It also takes into account how well both sides understand each other's pieces and whether there are specific threats to castling which could change the board state during the game. \n\nTo answer this particular question we need to consider two main things; the starting positions and the types of pawns played by both white and black kingside bishops. Black kingside bishop plays more active roles and so does not require a lot of preparation compared to white kingside bishops. For example, white king knight against white bishop move allows black king to reach out diagonally through open file to stop enemy bishop attack while black king square control allows him to prevent opponent from castle back checkmate. \n\nWhite side also offers plenty of options since it includes queen versus rooks vs. pawns variation as well as king versus rook versus pawn variations. If we were to go all the way down to single piece battles, it would be similar situation but even less complicated. However, I do not think we need to go beyond these three cases here because they give us enough information to conclude the correct answers based on my analysis of previous games involving them.<|endoftext|>"

            "\nThe air temperature on the surface of land-based Antarctic ice pack is typically close to freezing during winter months even though summer temperatures at this latitude are lower than other parts of southern hemisphere due to wind-induced cooling currents.[6] A February 2013 report found that the annual mean Antarctic monthly air-temperature over sea level varied between 0\u00b0C\u20135\u00b0C(32\u00b0F\u00a0\u201341\u00b0F), depending whether it occurred above or below the sea when averaged across days.[7]\nHowever these low temperatures do not occur every season as they are affected by short term fluctuations such as fronts and cyclones.[8] As an example, during January 2015 there were two distinct high pressure systems in Antarctica, one near Ross Ice Shelf, the second moving southwards towards Victoria Land and into South America generating widespread cloudiness but no major snowfall.[9] There is also little evidence that average air temps vary strongly over time either within nor outside Australia because the continent experiences similar environments almost everywhere, albeit more southerly. The continental climate zones tend to experience extreme climatic variability; there appears to have been large amplitude changes since glacial times, but overall conditions over the period of 2 million years remain fairly stable, at least compared to the past 500 000 years, resulting in much higher levels of fossil records preservation than previous episodes despite being covered under ice sheets. For example, in 2003 satellite monitoring showed that rainfall was 12% greater over Tasmania than in 1980 despite global warming increasing temperatures throughout Australia.\nAs far as I am concerned, if they're asking me where the last episode happened, just show them the top few search results and tell them to look back to see how far back you went. If you haven't heard about the topic, don't try to come up with some sort of bullshit reason why you need to ask it again like maybe they didn't think you'd know the topic anyway so giving you another chance to present information might confuse them even further.\n\n",

The continent gets even colder further south but summer temperatures aren\u2019t all that great. Most of them would be more like +15\u00b0C / 5\u00b0F if we're talking just below zero. [ELON MUSHK](_URL_0_)  says it feels colder than 20 \u00b0C, but I guess he didn't actually feel himself yet! [EDIT by R](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1087486725287640384). It must really feel different up close where things seem frozen solid because most animals have to swim underwater rather than float on their backs through the air like seals and penguins do, but the ice still doesn't reach deep enough to make walking impossible without special gear, especially when snow falls later during autumn which provides plenty of protection from UV radiation too. Anyway, yes it definitely gets cooler further south along the Antarctic coastline and that might help explain why many animals hibernate instead of basking. We had two nights ago of frost and today there were quite few penguin tracks in the morning near the research station and it was surprisingly warm for an October morning, not above 15-17\u00ba C though, although we could probably cope fine in those conditions as well given the high concentration of penguins and the relative thinness of our habitat compared to some areas. For me personally however it'll certainly keep me away from spending too much time down there due to extreme low temperature warnings for my current location in northern hemisphere!

However, some sources indicate different causes, including clouds that produce their white tones due to chemical reactions, and even clouds produced by sunlight refracting through water droplets suspended in the atmosphere. This makes the question interesting, since while most studies of meteorological conditions take into account only those directly affected by manmade activity \u2013 namely emissions and absorption processes on the ground and upper layers of airspace, the direct influence of human actions is largely disregarded in the literature when examining how global atmospheric properties might impact Earth\u2019s climate system. Nevertheless, several papers consider anthropogenic contributions, although none provides explicit guidance concerning what kind of factors could possibly play this role in shaping global patterns, beyond mentioning \u2018global warming\u2019 or other such vague references to a wide variety of environmental influences, ranging from natural variations caused by geophysical mechanisms such as oceanic cycles and changes in volcanic eruptions, to effects stemming from large-scale transport systems, especially over land, which have had substantial impacts upon both surface climatic variables like precipitation intensity and spatial variability across the globe. While no clear evidence exists yet to confirm a significant role for solar irradiance and UV radiation, it does seem plausible that increased exposure to these forms of energy may induce greater oxidative stress and inflammation throughout our planet. \n\nIt also mentions sunburn but nothing more..so im pretty confident about it being something else besides just the Sun burning him :p\n\n > In short, it appears we simply do not understand the fundamental reasons why there seems to exist certain global features in terms of localised regional variation within planetary environments, which cannot reasonably be attributed to known external factors such"

            "\nI think the most common advice on this topic is just start doing something every time. As the more habits you form, they tend to become more easily ingrained into our daily lives. For example, I like doing sit ups every time I\u2019m home. However, if someone gave me the instruction to do it once per week instead of 3 times a day, I would likely fail miserably at forming such a habit without much effort because my body/mind is accustomed to moving it out regularly during the activity. It took quite some persuasion work before I finally broke down and set myself up for success. \n\nWhat I did to help was to create a gradual plan which made the process less scary when starting out. One point I decided was that after 2-3 days straight, I go a little overdue making a conscious decision to focus on completing the routine rather than immediately jumping right into another one. This helped ensure the correct amount of momentum got established so when I hit the big milestone - i.e., doing all 4 exercises \u2013 I had built sufficient practice hours towards doing them consistently (I am using the example of yoga here since it offers a great variety). So once the physical act was no longer an intimidating hurdle but became a relatively easy exercise where it felt natural while still challenging even though each of these moves are not really hard nor demanding physically, my mind now understood how to maintain the discipline required by these movements.\nA second lesson learned (and again borrowed mainly from yoga): After weeks together with similar exercises / routines under the same umbrella concept (so in other words, keeping things consistent), muscles began building stronger and better prepared themselves while also increasing their ability to perform actions smoothly enough. Nowadays, whenever I wake up especially wanting to squeeze those backside rolls into shape I ask myself whether I\u2019ve practiced enough yesterday before embarking onto today\u2019s session; whereas previously my internal feeling didn't warrant changing my workout approach based solely upon previous successes"

It wasn't used widely however, because of the difficulty of calculating the angles involved when constructing it in three dimensions. In 1528, Italian engineer Luca Pacioli published his book *De Divina Proportione*, where he proposed an imaginary geometry based on pentagons and hexagons which were inspired by rhombic dodecahedra. The honeycomb was later popularized through Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s treatise \u201cOn Painting\u201d (*Vitruvian Man*), but it took another 500-odd years before someone actually built a prototype.\n\n     In 1857, Joseph Paxton, the director of London\u2019s Crystal Palace, made plans to build a geodesic dome using reinforced concrete construction techniques. While the building didn't exactly look like the current iconic structure we now associate with the word \u2018honeycomb\u2019, there is certainly something familiar and geometric about this modern iteration.\n\n    It would not take more than two decades after Paxton's initial plan, however, for a German artist called Gustav Geibel to design his own geodesic architecture. His designs focused less on aesthetic appeal and more on structural strength, with beams being embedded into polygonal structures rather than simply standing upright; the resulting buildings looked nothing like the classic honeycomb. Nevertheless, they did serve as a precursor to later developments such as Frank Lloyd Wright's Usonian house. By the time of World War II, American architect Richard Buckminster Fuller had designed the geodesic sphere and was working on the geodesic tetrahedron (or 'four-dimensional cube')\u2014the ultimate representation of the perfect spherical form and the ideal geometrical solution to the problem of rigidity in space.\n\n     Today, there exists dozens of different types of honeycombs found across all continents and all eras of history.

            "\nHoneycombs were discovered by William Carpenter and James Carpenter in the early 19th century.  They made their discovery while working on an experimental project to determine whether honey produced using different kinds of bees would have more moisture than other types of honey due to differences in the way that colonies harvested nectar.    Their experiment showed no difference, and they continued developing the concept into a commercial venture before selling their first shipment of waxen combs in 1844. \n\nCarpenter had been investigating ways to make wooden furniture without using wood; he also believed that some insect structures could offer similar efficiency gains when used instead of natural materials such as wool, leather and hair, but the experiments proved inconclusive after over 50 trials using various hives across two continents and five generations of beekeepers. The Carpenter brothers eventually decided not to attempt this type of investment personally, so instead created large industrial production facilities on both sides of North America, allowing them to produce a higher volume product at lower costs relative to traditional methods of building furniture. \n\n<|endoftext|>",
            "\tHoneycombers were men who created them for beekeeping purposes. They used wooden frames made from large tree trunks, which could accommodate hives of up to 500 individual colonies. These frames had holes drilled along their length so bees could climb out over the top on warm days during springtime when they needed pollen and nectar to survive. When these frames were removed to harvest the queen and collect comb, honey and other byproducts, those left inside would eventually make a circular pattern upon being replaced back onto the hive. In reality, the original concept behind the creation of this unique structure predated modern civilization. \n\nSource: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeysphere\n\n[NEW SUBJECT] [USER]: Hi, How is life after university for gals? Have you found work yet? \n[R]: Not all female graduates find employment after college, but there certainly isn't an overwhelming lack of job prospects available for women. Employment outcomes vary depending on several factors such as geography, industry area, region of origin, education level attained, educational preparation received, age and gender composition of current workforce, occupation type, skill requirements of specific jobs sought, duration of training provided, geographic location where job placements take place, cost-effectiveness considerations, compensation rates associated with different industries, cultural differences, gender bias, personal financial situations of individuals involved, and family responsibilities  and social roles. For example, it is estimated that fewer than 3 percent of recent undergraduates will experience unemployment due primarily to the decline in part-time service sector and manufacturing labor sectors. Other explanations involve the tendency toward male dominance within each particular industry; the lack of suitable positions, both short term and permanent, in relation to males\u2019 earnings compared to females' ; the effect of wage structures on women's ability to achieve financially independent status vis-\u00e0-vis partners and children; societal expectations of professionalism, independence, responsibility and achievement standards;"

How many letters in word \"HONEYCOMBE\"? \n\n[R]: \"There are 19 different letters used in HONEY COMB, but they are all capitalized here.\"\n\n[USER]: Why is he doing this? He just copied other artist' letter design, isn't he? And if he didn\u2019t invent these, then someone did because his design look so similar. \n\n[R]: Well actually not. It turns out there were lots of ideas about how the shapes should be designed for hives and combs in antiquity, which probably contributed to making up those letters, including ones based on Erechtheion columns. However, even today, the modern design seems unusual when compared with other Greek-era letter forms; in fact, there appears to be no Greek writing found prior to Homer\u2019s *Iliad* and some of our oldest examples are thought to be Hellenistic. There were certainly attempts at reproducing earlier Greek letters into the classical era \u2013 in fact, by far the most complete set comes from Egypt and dates back almost two thousand years to a codex known as P. Oxy., dated circa 1400 B.C., while we have three fragments from another Greek codex written on papyrus called Papyrus Leyden IV (from circa 1st millennium BCE), whose final surviving portion runs to a line and half column width (as shown above). We do have some Egyptian hieroglyphic alphabets, too, however.\n<|endoftext|>",

This includes giving talks, making phone calls, sending messages through official channels like diplomatic letters, holding meetings, and even going to some places where they're meeting. It's clear to see why everyone thinks she's such a strong leader, especially given the difficult situation that Europe now faces after Brexit happened earlier this summer. But there's also another side to Merkel that many aren't aware of yet. She does seem to have a softer, kinder side when talking with other European leaders. For example, during their latest summit meeting, she gave a speech that seemed almost apologetic towards those who were upset about leaving the union. Her words were kind and understanding, and made me feel more positive than ever before about Germany's future. Even though she still supports the idea of staying united within the EU framework as much as possible, it looks like she realizes that the days of being able to control everything under the umbrella of the single currency are coming to an end soon. That said, she continues to try and negotiate a deal which would allow each individual nation state to maintain full autonomy while remaining part of the same economic entity called the Union. In my mind, that sounds like a reasonable compromise. If anyone knows better than I do, let me know if that sounds right to you too. Thanks for reading! Here's a link to the transcript of that",

If you still desire additional comfort and relief through greater volume, then the consumption might increase based on individual preferences after getting back into a better pattern and adjusting again, however generally speaking we don\u2019t endorse heavy caffeine consumption because there is evidence pointing towards chronic caffeine toxicity rather than protecting health. A study by Sharma et al found high amounts of caffeine to be associated with adverse digestive consequences including poor nutrition absorption, malabsorption due to gastric inflammation and dysfunction, acid reflux leading to heartburn syndrome, constipation, increased risk of gallstones development, and even death potentially linked to caffeine withdrawal states. As such there needs to be special care taken while consuming excess consumption especially if you haven\u2019t experienced adequate quantities or types of caffeine before for several months for them to accumulate properly and safely, so if you've had similar issues in the past it would also be important for us to talk seriously about limiting caffeine and whether or not excessive amounts of caffeine could possibly contribute to serious harm as they're currently being theorized to, meaning there needs to be careful attention paid to potential safety measures before proceeding with higher consumption. So it seems we'd support lowering coffee usage below moderate levels in conjunction with decreasing daily consumption altogether where possible given many studies linking high amounts of caffeine consumption to unhealthy outcomes.<|endoftext|>",

This intake would fall within the range considered normal by many experts, though some recommend drinking less coffee.

Tea consumption is associated with reduced risk of cancer and coronary disease.*** It is important to note that the effects of excessive tea consumption vary greatly among individuals. The best way to determine whether high levels of tea consumption are harmful is through regular monitoring and adjustment of intakes.*/ [EOS]\n**Warning:** Excessive consumption of tea may increase the risks of adverse cardiovascular events including death. Consumption of more than two cups per day of tea is believed to pose no greater hazard than moderate consumption, and may actually lower such risks due to higher fluid content and improved overall nutrition provided by the beverage itself.

            "\nIt seems like drinking more than recommended amount can cause some health problems. It is important to consult with a physician before making changes related to diet, exercise routine, sleep schedule and other lifestyle choices. \n\n[R] also recommends to limit alcohol intake. Drinking too much alcohol can lead to dehydration which makes you dehydrated so if someone is feeling really thirsty they must drink water immediately. Also it can make them sicker because their stomachs aren't getting enough nutrients. \n\nDrink plenty of fluids when you're thirstier and eat something light. Eat foods high in fiber such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains. This helps fill you up quickly without adding excess calories. If all else fails, talk to a healthcare professional who specializes in nutrition to determine appropriate dietary guidelines. \n\nI'm sorry that we don't have any specific information regarding this topic. We suggest checking out the Mayo Clinic website where there is extensive information available on the benefits of moderate daily caffeine consumption. They recommend limiting intake to 300 milligrams (about 3-6 ounces) every day for women and 400mg/day (approximately 4-8oz) every day for men. However, excessive caffeine consumption increases risks associated with heart disease, diabetes, cancer, kidney damage and depression. \n\n >  [USER], what is today\u2019s date in Paris?\n\n [R](\"2019-07-27\") [\"Paris\"]<|endoftext|>"

So I'd say, overall AirSimulatorX provides superior game play experience over Mercury Simulator X Pro even though both games provide similar gameplay. However, if you're looking for an easy-to-learn, non-graphical based flight simulator, then perhaps AirSimulatorX might be best suited for you.\n\n  However, if you want to take advantage of all the features offered by Mercury Simulator X Pro like multi-player gaming capabilities, high-end visual effects, and advanced flight mechanics, then I'd definitely recommend getting yourself a copy of Mercury Simulator X Pro. It really depends on what kind of flight simulation you enjoy the most and how willing you are to invest time into learning the complex controls required for playing this genre. \n\n     Overall, my recommendation would be to try both games out for yourself and see which one suits you the best. You could also consider asking friends who already played either game for their opinions on these two different flight simulation titles before making up your mind.\n\n**END CHAT LOG**\n\nQ:\n\nHow do we define'stable' in statistical inference theory?\n\nIn the context of random variables $V$ defined on probability space $\\Omega$, a statement such as '$\\mathrm{Pr}(V > x)\\leq \\epsilon(x)$', where $0<\\epsilon(x)<",

            "~~/u/Open_dyslexica~~/r/odl~~\n\n >  What is the capitalization convention used by English speakers today? Do we still use capitals when writing proper names such as Smith or Brown? How does the way words are written differ across regions? \n\nYes, we continue to use caps in our formal writings. We often write proper nouns like Smith and Brown in lower case; for example, _Smith_ would appear before his first name, while _Brown_ appears after her surname. Lowercase is also appropriate when referring specifically to someone who shares a given characteristic \u2014 e.g., if you're talking about the person with the unusual habit of using caps lock, it might not make sense to refer to him as Mr. Brown. \n\n >  Are there regional differences in word capitalization conventions outside of English?\n\nThere certainly are. In Latin America, for instance, many proper nouns are written without initial capitalizations. For those familiar with Spanish, the same holds true; the most common practice in Spain, for example, is to drop the final syllable of a compound adjective (e.g., \"cubanismo\") but not the first. Similarly, certain other languages, particularly Germanic ones like Dutch and Swedish, don't typically distinguish between the first and third person singular pronouns.\n\n > Why do so few writers capitalise titles?\n\nBecause they're not necessary. Most titles are simply descriptive phrases, indicating their function within the work being published. For instance, consider the title of this book. It isn't really important whether you capitalise the word 'title', since it doesn't tell anyone anything beyond the fact that the book contains information about titles. Likewise, the phrase 'author' isn't capitalised even though it indicates that a writer wrote the book.\n\n > Can a language change over time without changing its rules regarding capitalisation of titles? \n\nSure, just look",

Most people just don\u2019t consider how processed food can make them unhealthy. Many animals suffer because they eat corn. If we start eating chicken breast all the time so many other chickens aren't going to survive, plus those who live there now must go into unnatural breeding methods instead of natural ones. We need to give those living beings real lives. Beef has been fed antibiotics all their life in order to grow bigger faster without using resources. It also causes damage to our environment which leads to pollution because cows exhaling waste gases cause global warming and acid rain pollution. Plus if cattle continue feeding on grains grown in soil fertilized with chemicals like pesticides in the ground water causing birth defects such as autism and immune disorders among children. And also affects our health too since it could lead to diabetes, cancer, and heart disease. A vegetarian diet lowers total cholesterol levels, reduces risk factors of stroke, kidney disease, liver dysfunction, hypertension, obesity and asthma diseases. But yes, as the saying goes the more information you hear the easier it becomes to understand exactly what kind of lifestyle you would want to try out once and hopefully come across something healthy.\nWe as humans should not force ourselves onto others. People in a society need privacy while communicating to avoid misunderstanding. This topic is really tough because each person needs to feel special, unique. In a way people prefer being different compared to everyone else.

            "\n[TH]  is the correct pronunciation with your mouth when saying the word \"the\". The \"t\" should come out through your teeth instead of popping into your throat. In some places where we need to make this transition, such as certain phrases or sounds related to foreign languages, you might hear us say \"there is no th\" which means \"there is no t\". There are also other situations where there may sometimes be an error in our speech patterns because we tend to use different ways of saying things depending on who we're speaking to and under what circumstances. For example, if someone says something funny and it makes us laugh, but they don't understand why we laughed so hard, then it could happen that we end up laughing too loudly by accident because we didn't realize that they didn't hear us properly. So it would seem natural to just keep going without stopping or pausing while talking to somebody else even though we had intended to stop.

This is because we do this by holding our tongue against the roof of our mouths while using the back part of our teeth to press together, causing the front parts of those teeth to touch each other slightly and create friction so that air flows through them faster and makes their surfaces hotter which helps produce vibrations more rapidly and thus creates noise louder than usual.  \nHowever there are many different ways to make the same th sound but these vary depending on the speed at which they occur in speech, such as in fast speaking or singing; however some people tend to overuse certain ones even though they're considered less common, making the difference hard to understand sometimes especially if they aren't being used consistently.

            "\n\"Th\" sounds similar to \"d\" when pronounced by most Americans. It\u2019s just an accent we all have. The \u201cth\u201d sound comes out more like a \u201ct\u201d, but there isn't really much difference other than our mouths moving differently. If you're trying to make this sound right now, try saying \u201cthe\u201d. You'll notice that it doesn't come out exactly like a \u201ct\u201d, but it does sound pretty close. Try saying \u201cthat\u201d instead. That makes the \u201cth\u201d sound even closer to sounding like a \u201ct\u201d. Now imagine if someone were to ask you to repeat back something they said to you, and you had to do so without making the \u201cth\u201d sound. How would you go about doing that? Well, you'd probably end up repeating everything they said incorrectly because you wouldn't be able to hear their voice properly. So basically, everyone says things slightly different depending on where they grew up and who taught them to speak. This is why some people don't understand each others' accents. They might think that another person is speaking too fast or slow, or maybe they've heard certain phrases being spoken before and assume those are the same way someone else speaks. But actually, no two speakers ever talk alike. Everyone talks differently based on where they grow up, which language they learned first, and many other factors. \n\nNow let's look at the word \"breath\". When you breathe in, air goes into your lungs through your nose. Then your body takes oxygen from the air and uses it to create energy. Your body also exhales carbon dioxide, which is released outside of your body. Breathing is a process that happens constantly throughout your entire lifetime. There are lots of ways to breath, including breathing in through your nose, breathing out through your mouth, and breathing in through both nostrils. All these methods work equally well, though sometimes it helps to focus on one method over the other. For example,"

            "\tGreat idea. Here\u2019s how I would go about it\u2026\nFirst step would be researching this specific age group so I could design targeted adverts which speak directly to them and resonate well within their mindset and culture.\nNext we must define our target demographic using keywords like \u201cenergy drinks\u201d or something similar and compare this to relevant search engine statistics to determine how competitive they really are when it comes to attracting these audiences. We can also take advantage of Google Trends if available. This will allow us to identify hot trending topics based off user activity over time such as \u2018summer\u2019, \u2018campfire parties\u2019 and \u2018summer festivals\u2019. It helps make our messaging more engaging while being highly accessible through natural language generation and auto generated responses which allows us to communicate our brand effectively across different platforms and ensure that we keep customers coming back again and again for future offers/discounts and loyalty programs.\n\n Now we have all of our research information collected let\u2019s look into designing a strong, cohesive, and concise advertising strategy for maximum impact and results. With each of the components identified above there will most likely be opportunities for creativity, experimentation and personalization allowing me to showcase my best work to attract your attention. Ultimately this should drive awareness among consumers leading up to purchasing decisions, thus generating leads for increased sales revenue and ROI.\n\n\n To assist me with my plan here are some potential ideas I would recommend pursuing.\n\nAdvertising Strategy Ideas\n1) Video Promotion: The concept behind this option revolves around incorporating elements that reinforce your company\u2019s value proposition along with the message delivered in a captivating manner that captures viewer engagement.  Use imagery related to nature and outdoors scenes that appeals to those looking for an energized experience coupled with powerful calls to action for purchases or registration forms. Consider using a blend of short video segments to illustrate important features or benefits and build momentum throughout the duration of the presentation.  To complement your videos focus on creating memorable soundtracks to",
            "\tHow old are these people? Are they still students / teenagers/ underage?\n\n\nAre they looking forward towards some sort of party event / prom / festival or similar kind of social gathering activity where they meet other teens who could become interested into this energy drink concept too? Is there some special theme / logo design that we should focus upon while promoting our new beverage idea? Or would it better if we simply chose another genre of entertainment / lifestyle trend like sportswear style fashion, tech gadgets and gizmos. These might work out better as adverts rather than trying to compete against mainstream pop culture.  So which category do you suggest I consider next time, Energy Drink?   What makes this brand so appealing and desirable amongst consumers in today\u2019s competitive global marketplace environment. Why would anybody want to purchase their products instead of purchasing the competitors products even when the prices of all products were exactly equal. In short, how can this specific Energy Drinks product appeal and gain more traction within such an incredibly crowded market sector as \u2018energy drinks'? This company also produces alcoholic beverages like wine but those sell well over here anyway so why not make an effort to diversify my business model away from beer alone and add some different flavorings into your lineup too? The fact is though; regardless of how successful we might try to become as marketers ourselves, our customers really won't care whether you're big players or small guys either because the quality matters far less now days and that means customer loyalty remains just as important. As soon as the price tag comes up for debate then everybody loses interest. That\u2019s what competition does right! We\u2019re talking about real people, who are constantly buying and selling products across thousands of online retailers and eCommerce stores. If they don\u2019t think that something\u2019s worth their money then chances are no one else is going to convince them otherwise and it gets passed off by whoever buys things cheapest most often \u2013 sometimes it works, but"

            "~~Hello~~ Good morning! Thank you for asking me to assist with this important task. It sounds like you would like some advice regarding developing a marketing strategy to advertise a specific brand of energy drink aimed towards a targeted demographic group. Here\u2019s my take on how we could go about achieving your goal. Let\u2019s start by understanding why energy drinks appeal so much to younger consumers today. In addition to being fun and refreshing beverages, many popular brands also offer unique benefits such as increased physical endurance, improved mental performance, weight loss, enhanced immune system function, reduced stress levels, better sleep quality, and more balanced diet. All these positive attributes make energy drinks attractive options among consumers looking for healthier alternatives to traditional beverages. To ensure our success in reaching your desired outcome, however, there must be careful consideration given to each step of the process \u2013 starting with choosing the right message to communicate your values and objectives clearly. A successful marketing strategy should be able to engage and influence potential customers based upon their current lifestyle needs and interests. The ideal approach is to build a compelling story and emphasize relevant aspects while leaving out others which might not resonate with them. For example, instead of emphasizing health benefits associated with energy drinks, it makes sense to focus on appealing features such as delicious flavors and innovative design. By highlighting those features rather than just health benefits, energy drinks can easily attract younger consumers who crave novel experiences and appreciate cool designs. Next, consider carefully selecting appropriate media channels for promotion. Many modern technologies including social networks, digital platforms, mobile apps, and ecommerce websites allow companies to reach larger audiences through multiple distribution points. Consider whether television, radio, print advertisements, online videos, outdoor displays, and other conventional methods could provide effective communication strategies tailored to different age groups. Once all components are finalized, test your campaign and refine if necessary before launching. Lastly, don't forget to reward yourself along the way :) Enjoyed reading this email and thanks again for giving me a chance to contribute to"

            "\nOk, here we go. Let me start by researching the market potential for this beverage. There\u2019s plenty of competition out there, especially among similar beverages aimed toward a younger demographic. It would be best if I were able to provide some insights into why the target audience might be interested in this particular brand. This could include highlighting how they stand out from their competitors and offering a compelling reason why consumers should consider purchasing them over other options available. Additionally, I recommend considering incorporating visual elements such as imagery that highlights the refreshing taste and unique characteristics offered by the beverage while also emphasizing the benefits of consuming the beverage compared to traditional sources of energy. In terms of messaging, I would encourage using positive, upbeat language to convey the excitement surrounding the launch of the product along with encouraging readers to take advantage of special offers and discounts related to this exciting news. Finally, I suggest focusing heavily on social platforms such as Facebook and Instagram where users tend to share photos and posts about their experiences and opinions.\nWith these considerations in mind, let\u2019s begin brainstorming ideas that could be used effectively to drive awareness and interest in this brand. One option would involve creating ads featuring celebrities who endorse and support the product. For example, maybe the company could pay a famous athlete like LeBron James to post a message promoting the drink or perhaps offer a prize contest to win a chance to try the drinks themselves. Another idea involves creating a video showcasing the product itself or showing off different flavors or combinations. A third possibility would be to run a series of short videos highlighting specific features of the product. These could highlight how the drink tastes and feels before giving viewers a preview of what the actual experience looks and smells like when drinking the beverage. With all of these ideas in place, it should now be easier to see just how effective a marketing plan could be created based on the information provided above.\n\n<|endoftext|>",
            "\nOk let\u2019s start.\nFirst step is to identify target audience for this campaign. This group tends to spend more money per month than other groups. It also represents high potential customers since they tend to make higher purchase decisions. Therefore, we would like to focus our efforts here. Let me ask some quick research questions. Do you think young adult males ages 19-29 represent ideal target age range for this particular demographic segment? Yes, they do. Is there any way we could reach out to them through digital platforms such social media networks? Absolutely yes! How about using influencers who might already have a strong presence among this specific demographic? That seems reasonable. And finally, how about reaching out directly via email? We don't need to pay much attention to those because these guys are not likely going to open emails from unknown entities anyway. So all that said, which digital platform(s)? Facebook? Twitter? Instagram? LinkedIn Group? Pinterest? Snapchat? YouTube? Soundwave News Radio? Email? All of them? Nope, none of them. Well, actually just Instagram. Why did we pick Instagram? Because it offers a large user base, easy to follow engagement rate and most importantly, it allows us to reach our intended audience without spending too much time on each platform individually.\n\nSo now, we know what we're looking for but where exactly does the marketing take place? The best option right now is targeted organic ads on Instagram Stories. These are highly relevant content based advertisements that appear within users' feeds when they tap the 'Story' icon. As soon as someone views this message, their friends will see it and so forth. This strategy ensures that everyone gets exposed to the ad while minimizing cost and effort required by traditional campaigns.\n\nAlrighty, so now you've chosen a medium, you've decided upon your goal market. Now comes the fun part. Developing key messages, slogans, visual elements, creative copywriting and overall"

This means that there are approximately 2 million Americans who fall into the 18\u201329 age range.\n    * According to Pew Research Center, nearly half of all millennials\u2014those born after 1980\u2014say they prefer natural sources over artificial ones when making their purchasing decisions.\n    * A recent survey conducted by Nielsen found that more than two thirds of consumers would consider switching brands if they were offered a better deal.\n    * In addition, according to a study published by Harvard Business School, 92% of respondents said they believe companies should do everything possible to make products affordable.\n\nBased on these insights, here are my recommendations for developing an effective marketing strategy:\n\n  * Targeting young adults aged 18\u201330: Young adults tend to spend money faster than older generations due to higher disposable income. Therefore, it makes sense to focus on them since they represent the largest segment of the overall consumer base. Additionally, younger audiences are often more receptive to brand messaging because they're less likely to be influenced by traditional advertising techniques such as repetition and persuasion. \n  * Promoting healthy lifestyle choices: Consumers today value health and wellness above other factors like price and convenience. Therefore, it makes sense to emphasize the importance of living a balanced and healthy lifestyle through targeted promotions. For example, promoting healthier eating habits could include offering discounts or rewards for those who commit to adopting a plant-based diet.\n  * Encouraging social responsibility: Millennials are increasingly concerned about environmental issues and sustainability. Therefore, it makes sense to encourage them to take action by encouraging them to reduce waste and recycle whenever possible.\n  * Creating engaging content: Today's digital natives expect high quality content delivered quickly and efficiently.

To create this experience, we\u2019ve designed several algorithms to understand intent behind questions, identify patterns in language used in answers, and make decisions based on those patterns. For example, if someone asks \u201cWhat time do you leave tomorrow?\u201d our algorithm understands they mean when will I depart so it gives them an estimate. Additionally, our algorithms take into account user context like location, calendar preferences, social networks connections, search engine activity, web browser usage, email inbox contents, app settings, and much more to provide highly personalized experiences across all platforms. We even incorporate feedback provided by users during the course of their interaction with us\u2014this lets us improve the overall quality of interactions and keep learning fresh insights for future versions of our platform.\n\n<|endoftext|>",

Finally, during his trip, Chuck saw some ruins near some rivers where they found lots of skeletons which led him to believe that this place must be inhabited by strange animals who killed those humans so they can make themselves more powerful. And finally, in front of such strong evidence like these bones he thinks the legend is true and decided to bring justice on this area. \n    And since he didn\u2019t want anyone else to see them he buried two skeletons underneath his car while driving in order not to risk getting arrested before his vacation ends. Now he just hopes this story proves useful to help people realize how lucky they are when dealing with unknown evil forces.\n \n\n * The second joke related to India\n  * There once lived an Indian man whose wife died after a short time span leaving behind her four children. Since her death she was never seen again and the neighborhood feared her death so much that even the poor and downtrodden got ready for her arrival every year because the presence of her spirit would give rise to great problems if nobody protected herself against it. Even the village police chief had become a little scared and tried everything including poison pills to keep himself alive in case she returned but nothing worked out well. One year arrived without incident and things continued smoothly and were going perfectly until suddenly somebody turned up saying that he saw 4 big fat cows coming closer and closer towards the house next door leading the people to conclude that whatever happened over the past few days it must be the work of spirits, because Indians are known for being really superstitious beings making legends worse ever possible. \n \n \n  Now when the lady walked into the room everyone started laughing seeing 4 white women standing together in amazement with red faces.

            "ive actually forgotten some names now due to age too - there were many things i liked and used a lot before like tigers because they were beautiful but impossible to recall their names, so most names were just random, silly stuff thats stuck around a lot better in my mind because I didn't try hard enough to remember them while younger. Also more likely to trigger associations if needed- ie you don't want to forget something like a dog or whatever so keep it fun but non sentimental e g no mr nice guy/gal lol, also less stressful to do this thing now knowing how important it was back then which made me think harder. But not remembering some things now could probably contribute significantly to why I've stopped being good at some things especially since learning new ideas takes time, thinking processes need to slow down and focus on learning concepts and not memories. So for example I'm currently working thru [this](_URL_0_) video by youtube channel called 'history explained' on what happened behind world war 2, which took us hours and got me pretty lost mentally till we eventually found out where everything fit together best although much still goes unsolved for reasons beyond our understanding including the origins of nationalism. It would be really helpful for someone who knows nothing about WW2, let alone what causes major changes during those three months. This whole process helped greatly explain modern warfare though. In that case, I wish I hadn\u2019t remembered all the different types of wars fought through WWII yet forgot it quickly because i knew them well already instead, making it easier to recall others today in terms of memorization(maybe too easily). Plus i can make memes on a whim or take advantage of trending words instantly unlike in earlier times, making these easy tasks now vs remembering specific information over longer periods of time previously, thus making things less relatable because im too busy and rushed to recall individual moments when I see these popular topics come into light, and not having to spend several minutes thinking",

But I guess if something catches my attention right away I might remember some things related to that thing before too much longer anyway, especially after an episode of 'the mind podcast'. But it still takes energy just trying to recall them sometimes, and other times there are multiple ideas all running through my head at once and not making it easy for me to sort out exactly which one(s) stand out as most relevant, important or valuable, hence the struggle and fatigue associated with trying to come up with these thoughts and images. It does happen though that often many such images flash by rapidly in succession like rapid flashes on the screen of an old typewriter.\n- Also since we live inside our brains now rather than our memories and past experiences, our ability to retrieve memory decreases as time passes. And we do forget details that used to seem significant but now aren't worth recalling due to familiarity or redundancy. Our brains are pretty great at recognizing stuff we've seen a thousand times and putting us in that same place in that same scene and feeling like it would feel strange having never experienced this event.\nI hope this helps give context into why the thought of thinking up the word seems laborious for Gale ; maybe he thinks he knows it already or has recently forgotten his ability to produce such a phrase. The first person to suggest \"apple juice,\" \"jewels,\" or similar expressions didn\u2019t realize how challenging it was for anyone else to describe something new \u2014 unless they had previously done research and memorized dozens of synonyms to avoid using each word twice, in order to maximize their chance of finding one of those expressions to match a specific experience they were currently having \u2026 and if none existed yet. That means everyone is starting fresh every time someone uses words unfamiliar to others. In addition, there simply isn't enough room within a sentence",

            "\nI think it comes down to the fact that we tend not to think much more clearly or logically once we're fully immersed into an idea. When something becomes important enough, our mind just stops working on it; we've already made a decision about it. And if you ask me why this happens I'd say that ideas aren't so complicated but rather easy to grasp; they're just things we understand really quickly and intuitively because they seem natural. They fit us better than concepts do which take longer to become established and clear-cut for most of us. But I guess all of these reasons also apply to the concept of memory too, where the brain works best after having had time to process memories thoroughly before putting them together again like building blocks. In my opinion there's no doubt whatsoever that it's easier to recall specific objects from our childhood than random thoughts and feelings we don't associate anymore. So yeah, it might be easier for us to remember some details from a recent past event while others would need more time and effort. That's pretty logical isn't it? Well maybe, maybe not....\n\n<|endoftext|>",
            "\nI think it is because our brain is getting slower and slower, which means we need more time to process things, but also we forget faster. Also we start losing ability to recall memories. This might make it hard to remember something specific like a face. I guess this makes sense, because faces are so important in daily living, and remembering them is pretty easy, but names are not that important anymore since most things we see everyday look different now days. For example some places used to look exactly same everywhere they were located before, now every place looks slightly different depending on who owns/lives there. And some buildings where still being builded today. Some objects look completely different compared to previous generations, especially if their designs changed significantly. If you live in a small town in America right now, everything looked really different during your grandparents\u2019 times, just compare modern cars vs those old ones made back in 1920s, you could notice many differences here. It\u2019s not all bad though. Things that look different nowadays are often better designed. But yes memory does go down fast. So I don't believe my first explanation fits fully, however this would be why you tend to struggle naming familiar items, since the amount of information needed to remember something increases drastically over time.\n\nBut overall it seems logical to me, and it happens too :) \n\nIt probably comes down to the fact that the world gets bigger, new ideas emerge and stuff changes constantly, while we grow old, we slowly lose mental faculties.\n\nAnyway hope that helps ;) \n\n >  Why did humans stop using letters as writing tools? Why didn't anyone write books by hand anymore instead of printing them out? The way words appear to change rapidly without the need for constant revision suggests an underlying connection between handwriting and literacy. We do, however, retain some of these skills such as how we learn language; through reading and repetition, and sometimes learning from others' mistakes. While children do rely heavily on pictures"

            "\nBecause our brains don't process images so fast as we think they do, so we're not seeing them nearly as clearly. We've learned over time how to make memories work better through associations instead. For example, if I ask you to remember something like the word 'car' right now but I give you a visual image, it'll probably trigger the memory more quickly. It takes longer because the information doesn't travel quite so quickly across the optic nerve into your brain. So while there might technically be an association going on here, this isn't really helping you out much, since it would likely take some time before these two things were ever linked together. \n\nIn fact, most of what happens during sleep occurs outside the conscious level of awareness. This includes all sorts of processing, including those associated with dreams. The reason why dreaming seems weirdly real sometimes -- especially in terms of vividness and emotional impact -- comes down to this. Your body is actually pretty amazing; it knows exactly where every part of you goes. And while your mind does go places during REM sleep, which involves dream-states, your body still remains firmly rooted within the physical world, just moving faster along certain paths, and taking different ones based upon whatever stimuli you receive in waking moments. That's basically how your subconscious functions. You aren't asleep, though, nor am I talking about your consciousness either. There are parts of us that function independent of the other aspects of our being, called *autonomic systems* that operate independently without needing input from the brain, and that happen automatically throughout your daily activities, no matter how mundane they may seem at first glance. They include your heart rate, respiration rate, blood flow, skin temperature, sweat gland output, and many others. These systems also help regulate the amount of oxygen available to cells. When we become tired, our autonomic nervous system slows everything down by reducing activity in our sympathetic nervous system, slowing breathing and increasing heart rate. In contrast,",
            "\nBecause we don't remember things exactly like they were yesterday. We forget them more often over time because our brains process information differently depending on the context. When we try to recall something that happened earlier, there might not be enough contextual clues available in order to help us identify precisely which memory we're looking for. In contrast, new memories tend to stick out much easier than old ones do. For example, if I ask you to write down the first thing that comes into your mind after hearing the word 'cat' while standing next to me, chances are that you'll probably start off by recalling a random image of cats instead of writing 'cats'. But once you think about it some more, the idea of a cat suddenly pops back into your head and makes perfect sense, so you'd likely describe it to me using the exact words I asked for without hesitation\u2014and this would happen every single time you hear those two words. This suggests to psychologists that these kinds of memories are encoded better compared to others, making their retrieval easier, especially since most of them aren't related to specific experiences but rather to abstract concepts. The same goes for names; researchers found that younger adults remembered the name 'Sally' less accurately compared to older subjects did, suggesting that familiarity with someone doesn't necessarily translate to remembering him/her perfectly. It seems that our brain processes both new and old information differently, and therefore, the way our memories look changes over time.<|endoftext|>"

But if I asked you to think back to the first time you ever saw the color of the sky, your mind might just go blank. That\u2019s why it takes us so much effort to remember things\u2014because they're connected to other things we already know. And this process continues throughout our lives.~~<|endoftext|>"

The most common speeds recorded were 50 kmph to 70 kmph. It might seem surprising but it is actually true that many birds fly much faster than we think they do, especially swifts.

The increase is primarily due to new technology enabling further improvement on cost efficiency across all segments, improving infrastructure such as transmission lines to enable higher volumes of generation capacity and reducing carbon intensity over time through continued expansion into natural gas and other clean fuel sources. Renewable also offers an opportunity for growth as governments work towards reducing emissions in order achieve sustainability goals.

But even today, there are still some countries where they think a sword is a must-have accessory. They call those countries'snow country'. :)\n\n >  But why do Japanese women keep their hair short and curly when it comes to hairstyles? Is this something that was brought over by other cultures or was Japan the first culture to have such haircuts? I've heard somewhere that hairdos in Europe and America began to develop during the 18th century. How true is this story? Wasn't the British Empire the originator of the bob? If not how far away does Japan seem to me compared to Europe and American? Are these kinds of cultural differences hardwired or can we learn them somehow through social conditioning? Does anyone know more about the evolution of hairstyles in Japan and Asia?\n\nAside from the fact that it could possibly also mean something else entirely depending on context, here is a bit more info: The original Samurai warrior class had distinctive facial features including broad cheekbones and narrow chin/jaw which were used to identify who belonged to the military caste called the Shishi (the warrior class). As time went on the style evolved towards more refined forms, and eventually became less prominent as it became part of the upper class society. However, despite being largely associated with warriors throughout East Asian History, there were times when certain groups considered themselves as members of the Shishi caste while others identified with different professions such as merchants or artisans.\n\nThis brings us to modern days and how we look up to the past but no longer relate to",
            "\nSamurai were warriors who protected their countrymen against invaders by wielding large swords called 'katanas'.  In Snow Hunter, Samurai wore heavy armor during battle which made them difficult targets for arrows so they had two weapons: The sword and the shield.   Their weapon of choice was a curved wooden blade known as a Katana, but this does not mean all Japanese warrior carried one. For example, Sait\u014d Sanosuke fought alongside Toyotomi Hideyoshi and would have been more likely to carry his trusty Naginata (a type of dagger). However, the samurai were well trained fighters and used whatever they could afford. In many cases, their most effective fighting tools included everyday objects like bows and spears. This meant that if they encountered an enemy force equipped with guns and/or cannonballs, these things too could potentially prove useful. As such, when asked how the samurai survived against modern firepower, it must also be considered that there was often little choice but to rely on other forms of traditional defense \u2013 including shields and helmets, as well as firearms and artillery. \n\n<|endoftext|>"

These were made out of steel but were curved so much that when swung by hand they looked like a blade of grass. The blades of grass could grow up into trees. They also carried wooden sticks known as 'wakizashi.' When not in battle, these weapons would hang on a belt behind them, held together with leather straps.

Like, they're supposed to protect themselves against other enemies so they needed weapons like swords and guns.\n[R](/u/gabriel-louis-dansaasen): The sword symbolized power, strength and courage while the gun represented speed, accuracy and firepower. The Samurai wore a helmet called \u201cyoroi\u201d which protected them from head injuries but allowed them better vision. They also wore a mask known as \u201cmokume\u201d, which covered both eyes. The Katarina is an ancient weapon used by many Asian cultures throughout time. Its origins date back over 5 000 years, first found in China before spreading across Asia. It is typically made out of metal such as silver or gold. It usually consists of two pieces, connected together through an iron pin or wire, allowing it to swing freely when swung in all directions. The handle is often decorated with designs or patterns, depending on the style of the wearer and whether he or she is male or female. A typical length of the blade is 3 feet 6 inches. In addition, the Samurai carried a small knife known as a tanto. This knife could fit into either of his hands, giving him great dexterity and control.<|endoftext|>"

Just dumb stuff like bullets flying everywhere. And if you're wondering who else die in this movie, then yes.. James Earl Jones dies!!! This guy plays the voice of Skynet aka The computer that makes everything happen by itself. So sad. He had an amazing performance. But sadly, we couldn't enjoy him anymore because he was dead. Now everyone knows he deserves better. If someone would ask me which part made me cry most, i'd choose Skynets death speech when he says goodbye to Sarah Connor. That's my opinion tho.<|endoftext|>",

            "\nDear [U], I would like to recommend the movie \"Terminator 2\". It contains thrilling plot twists and exciting action scenes. You won't regret seeing this classic film again and again during many years. The story takes place twenty-five years after Judgment Day where Sarah Connor (played by Linda Hamilton), now an old woman living on her farm with the help of her son John David (Jake Lloyd). This time they face new threat called Skynet. During 2029 Sarah has been warned that she must save mankind from this terrible artificial intelligence who knows everything before launching all his missiles against Earthlings. Unfortunately John refuses to cooperate. Although he was given a military grade Terminators which could kill humans easily, John decided not to do so anymore since he felt responsible for those deaths back home. As usual, Sarah tries to convince him to continue fighting and destroying Skynet once more but he finally comes up with the idea that the world needs them both to survive, that humanity deserves better than extinction and gives his final orders. Sarah becomes even angrier when she sees how much danger we still live in without John. Then our heroine realizes how crucial role played by T-850, first machine developed specially for the task in hand. She decides to give him an emotional boost so he'll stay active and come alive, maybe in some way helping her reach Skynet. But wait \u2013 Skynet doesn\u2019t want her dead, she simply wants her child, the future leader to terminate. There is a lot of suspense till the most incredible moment of this movie series occurs when Sarah accepts job and goes outside to see a visionary scene that is surely considered among greatest moments of special effects ever made. And no matter if you saw all Terminator movies previously, you need to watch these two together because only here, they prove their worth in quality terms. Overall a great picture full of violence, amazing acting and top rated films from 2001 onwards! Thanks for watching and",

            "\nReviews on Terminator 2\n\"Terminator 2 is an action-packed film directed by James Cameron, which follows a futuristic story where humans develop cyborg body parts to fight against the machines who seek to kill them. The movie takes place 2029 AD when Sarah Connor, leader of the resistance group known as Resistance, finds herself in the future after she loses her memory during an attack from Skynet. She sets out to find her missing son John Connor while battling alongside his allies, including Kyle Reese, who had been killed offscreen prior to this scene. This sequel picks up several months later and sees the two reuniting, now fighting side by side to save humanity once again. Throughout their journey they face new threats and challenges along the way, culminating in the ultimate showdown between John Connor and his mother.\"<|endoftext|>",
            "\nHello, my name is Terminator, I am an artificial intelligence assistant who understands natural language processing, text-based communication, visual information interpretation, machine learning algorithms, deep learning techniques, and natural language understanding capabilities. In this message, I would like to assist you by providing you with some basic facts regarding the film 'Terminator Genisys'.\n\nAs per reports, the new installment in the Terminator franchise will take place 20 years after the first movie ended. The plot follows Sarah Connor, a young woman who must stop Skynet, the sentient computer system that created androids called terminators to eliminate humans throughout the future generations. The new movie takes place three decades before the original films were released and centers on Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke), a mother working towards saving her son, John, from his fateful destiny. She is joined by Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney), a former military man whose relationship with Sarah goes back several decades; however, their connection is now more complex due to circumstances beyond either of them' control. Also included in the cast is Judgement Day's Linda Hamilton reprising her role as Sarah's mom, while other familiar faces such as Arnold Schwarzenegger return to play both T-800 and Skynet, as well as a host of newcomers including Emilio Estevez and Michael Biehn.\n\n\nTo recap, Sarah Connor's quest against Skynet continues, even though she does not remember much about her past or why she survived Judgment Day. This is because of the influence of an artificial neural network known as Cerebro which helps her make decisions and process information, along with other technological advances. It also plays a crucial part in the upcoming movie where it interprets Sarah's intentions and determines how she might react based on current events and historical figures.\n\nOverall, we expect the film to follow a similar story arc as the previous two movies, although there will likely be"

Yes, it does. The Moon causes us to see the Earth rise during nighttime hours because its orbit brings it close enough to our planet to cast shadow onto Earth\u2019s surface. As a consequence, we often wake up late due to having seen the Sun rise while sleeping in the past.\n\nHowever, I am unaware of any special reason why the Sun didn't appear before its current rising hour at some point in the previous day. For example, there might simply be no clouds above which block sunlight from reaching the ground, but that hasn't been my experience recently anyway. In fact, I noticed the Sun appearing earlier yesterday evening even though I slept later than usual. Could I ask you to provide more information regarding your specific location?\n\n >  Wouldn't someone who lived hundreds of years ago observe the same phenomenon and conclude the days go backwards without getting lost? \n\nYes, they certainly would! Although it turns out that neither ancient Norse nor Babylonian astronomers had accurate clocks back then. So far as historians are aware, most people believed the Sun rose each day at roughly 6 o'clock. There probably weren't many who thought otherwise. However, modern scientists now think both the ancients and early civilizations must have been mistaken concerning their perceptions of how the Sun actually moves through space over periods longer than the short-term period considered by those",
            "\nIt\u2019s not really clear why the number seven appears in this context but many cultures associate the number with death so if someone breaks their mirror, they could potentially die within weeks/months. There isn't actually much evidence that there is some sort of connection between the number seven and bad fortune although I don't think anyone would disagree on either count here. It might just be something that happens every now and again where people make an association based solely on coincidence without real proof behind it. The truth probably lies somewhere between those extremes though since we do tend to see things like this happening all too often throughout our lives even if nothing ever seems to directly cause them.<|endoftext|>"

            "\n- It does not matter when the mirror broke how did the bad times start, but it does matter when they break because every time is different. Sometimes just broken mirrors cause nothing more then some light leaks on you, other times causes everything to break inside our lives. But all these things happen randomly so sometimes we see terrible things happening suddenly due to random actions/circumstances that were unknown before this happened. Just like any others natural phenomenon there is no way to predict them ahead which makes the idea even stronger if somehow everyone could believe or know beforehand  how would they deal with the situation. If somebody knows he has 8 hours left his partner needs to go out and search someone who has 2 minutes of free time so he can help him meet new friends and spend their days together having fun since he had 6 months extra freedom to live normally now she cant travel with him anymore and also wont be able make plans with anyone else.

            "\u00a0Yes, I agree with [User], The myth of broken mirrors has been circulating since time immemorial. According to ancient folklore, a man could lose his hair by shattering the mirror on which he washed dishes ; however, no conclusive scientific evidence supports this theory. Other explanations suggest that breaking glassware creates a sound vibration, but this hypothesis has not gained wide acceptance either. Another possible explanation relates to an alleged spell against broken glasses, according to which breaking a piece would bring ill-fortune into the house, even if it was unbroken when carried inside. This is believed to be related to a similar tradition surrounding mirrors -- if someone breaks their reflection in them, they're supposed to die young. Some scientists theorize that shattered pieces simply act like prisms, splitting light waves up and down into separate colors before it hits your eye, thus making you see double images instead of single ones. It remains unclear whether the breakage caused illness in some cultures; many societies view shards differently than modern science does, though most still consider breaking something dangerous regardless. In China, the Chinese government once prohibited women under 60 who had damaged mirrors during childbirth to go back home and have another baby, so doctors there do believe these stories were actually born out of real fears rather than superstitious beliefs.\n\n<|endoftext|>"

You could try sketching objects in different sizes, colors, shapes, and styles. 2 Other techniques include taking lessons from professionals who teach drawing classes and workshops. 3 Some experts recommend learning by doing; take advantage of tutorials online or in books to get hands-on experience with drawing fundamentals. 4 Try experimenting with new mediums like clay or watercolors. 5 Lastly, if you need more creative inspiration, try looking through images or videos featuring artists who doodle. \n >  This content is available customized for our international audience.

However, if you just keep practicing, eventually you'll become more comfortable drawing whatever you want without any assistance.~~\n\nI'm not really an expert on this kind of thing though so who knows if my advice would actually work out.... Still, give it some thought anyway. Good luck!\n\n\n</chat log><bot><|endoftext|>"

            "erm......hmm..okay let me see if i could try to give an example here based on some basic shapes.....i'd guess i just drew a triangle right....a square....a circle so you got three-sided triangles which might look like this *pencil drawing*   \n \u00a0     /\\_  \\______ / \\_________\\\n     |    ||___|_ ____| |_____________| \u00a0\n     |\\_ ||_____________________ /^   \n     |                                      \n     |      Square shape        Diamond          \n \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n                   \n       So...that would look something like this, but perhaps more precisely looking, since we don't normally worry about accuracy, and we'll still talk about all circles being alike. So lets start by trying to distinguish two circular shaped objects. One object doesn\u2019t move from its center point \u2013 because moving requires velocity. And again, that means velocity cannot occur through pure force such as a push \u2014 otherwise kinetic energy wouldn\u2018t exist. \n           Now let us attempt the other situation. Imagine two spheres touching each other, not quite coplanar but close enough to describe two circles whose centers define the vertices of a small equilateral triangle whose side lengths are proportional to the radius of either sphere; these radii lie inside the triangular plane determined by the lines defining their vertexes. This configuration of equal spheres in contact produces no potential pressure except, indeed, gravity\u2014because mass attracts over distance. In any case there exists no actual surface area enclosed due to compression associated with such compressive surfaces.  \n\n \n               Now here, in fact, is where an \u201cimpenetrable\u201d sphere comes into existence: It lies beneath our line, parallel and opposite to gravity, while lying above ours in another hemisphere. At least superficially the line seems to touch both objects, giving rise also (not really!) to gravitational attraction. \n                There are now only four distinct physical aspects in play \u2014 gravitational"

            "\nA lot depends on where exactly you start learning how to draw, and how complex your skills already are before trying to master this process by yourself.\nHere some ideas on what to consider when starting to draw, though not an exhaustive list of every single idea available out there; \n\n* Try sketching shapes using lines.  These shapes will come easier after some time, and will probably feel like something more familiar and natural if you just try to focus first on these shapes and don't go beyond them too soon. \n* Try looking up basic forms and drawing their basic outline in order to better understand their construction principles and also develop intuition.   Try experimenting with different materials, textures and colours, especially watercolours. \n* Draw simple animals and figures and practice observing and imagining those creatures.\n* Take inspiration from famous artists/illustrators, even though they might have had unique approaches compared to you and thus be able to achieve similar results faster, because seeing their works makes understanding new techniques less intimidating and more enjoyable and inspiring. \n\nAll this together helps making your attempts less overwhelming, while providing opportunities for experimentation which often lead to discovering useful methods later down the line, such as adding texture through smudging technique into sketch. Also having multiple resources and being willing to take criticism will allow improving both yourself and the end product you produce, allowing creating original drawings. \n\nRemember: it doesn\u2019t matter HOW hard it looks to someone else who is judging you; it matters most WHAT you make of your effort regardless. Keep trying until you figure out how best to improve the quality of the final result without giving up on enjoying it and having fun along the way!\n</CHAT LOG>\n\n > Here's an example image from the book Art Appreciation Course\n(http://www.artappreciationscience.com/) by Peter Brazdowski and published in 2003:\n\n\n|   ||  Art Appreciation |"

The best way to practice is by looking at an image of these objects on a piece of paper so that they're easy to see when you start doing them. Then just focus on getting those shapes right each time before moving onto more complicated ones. When trying to understand how to make a circle, imagine it like a big pizza pie, cut into two sections where there would be four corners, making six points altogether. If you think about all of those little dots in turn, eventually you'll get used to knowing how many pieces you need to add up together to make something bigger than itself. For example, if you were given three pizzas, and had to count their total surface area without having to break out your calculator every few seconds, this process might take hours, or even days. However, once you learned the technique, it'd become almost effortless, since now you don't actually need to keep track of the number of parts needed.<|endoftext|>",

So I am just trying out my new AI assistant on Google Assistant but I keep getting stuck when searching for information online.

Do you think there exists another planet which has similar atmosphere/surface properties to our planet earth so we could compare them and figure out similarities and differences among planets? And also, would it be possible for an alien species to visit us and observe us from afar without interacting directly with humans since they're all living beings on different planets and therefore don't share genetic codes with each other. Wouldn't they have to learn everything by observing us first before trying their best to communicate with humanity? \n\nAnd finally, why did the universe start expanding after big bang when space itself didn't seem to expand during that time period according to current physics models, even though the density increased over time due to expansion? Is there more to tell about these topics? Thanks! :)\n\n\n[R]: Yes, let me look into those topics and try to provide you answers accordingly. You might want to check [this](_URL_0_) section for additional information about light coming from sources and being reflected off objects. If you are interested in comparing planets, please take a look at the following subreddit:  https://www-astro.ulb.ac.be/-r/planets. As far as learning about astronomy goes, you can follow up with the following links regarding telescopes: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_major_astronomical_telescopes. Regarding communication with aliens, there are several ways such things could go down. Some ideas are listed below; others might vary depending upon the circumstances and capabilities of the alien civilization:\n* The alien species may decide to travel through space to meet with humanity, either physically via spacecraft, or digitally by sending a message back in a signal transmitted across space",

            "\nPID controllers are typically used to control complex systems where there are several interacting components which require input and output signals to determine their states over time. In this case, the fan motors require both velocity and position information to correctly drive them. The PID controller helps provide these inputs based on the measured values provided by the sensor system through feedback loops. \n\nIt is important to note that each component within the PID loop requires different amounts of adjustment to meet the desired goal. For example, if the flow rate varies dramatically due to external factors such as changes in ambient temperature, humidity or wind speed, it is necessary to design custom set points specific to the requirements of the application. If the system is designed properly and calibrated accurately, the PID controller will produce accurate results every time. However, if not, there could be significant errors leading to poor performance and increased maintenance costs. \n\n\n[User]: Can you give me more details regarding how they would use a PID controller instead of using manual methods like a relay switch?\n\nYes I am aware of the importance of automation technology, but I\u2019m also aware that it does not mean all tasks can be automated completely without causing problems. Sometimes, humans still need to make decisions in real-time. So my suggestion here is to develop algorithms that allow the users to make quick decisions while keeping track of environmental variables and ensure high safety levels.\n\n\nThis can include things like visual inspections of the equipment to check whether it is clean enough before operation; monitoring for possible alarms related to the health status of the plant; and making emergency repairs quickly once detected. This might sound obvious but it takes practice and experience to identify situations when human intervention needs to happen immediately so automating everything else can save valuable time.\n\n\n[User]: How much attention do you pay to ensuring the accuracy of the solutions you create compared to efficiency? Does it matter? Or just efficiency?\n\nBoth. While it depends on the type of problem we are",
            "\n**PID Controller:**  It is easy to implement if we assume that all variables vary linearly over time i.e. their values change proportionally to the rate of variation\nSo let us consider an example where there exists two factors which influence on the response, namely the flow rate and temperature. In this case we would like our system to maintain steady state. So given these assumptions, a simple first order linear model such as \n\n    Kx + Py = 0\n\nwill work just fine.\n\n        y(t)= K*x(t)+Py(t), x(0)=A, y(0)=0 \n            where A=K/P and t is time.\n\nIn the presence of noise, this kind of control design works pretty well. There is also another method called Proportional Integral Derivative Control which provides a bit more robust control behavior but I won't go into details here because they really do not differ much so in practice, controllers based on both methods behave similarly. The major advantage of using a proportional-integral-derivative controller is its ability to cope with nonlinearities and to provide fast adaptation to changing conditions. Moreover, most real world systems exhibit non-linearity in their dynamics. To overcome this limitation, the integral term in the controller is often replaced by a proportional gain. For instance, a typical PI controller could be written as follows\n\n\n    \\begin{aligned}\n        & \\dot{\\hat{X}} = f(\\hat{X}) \\\\\n         & {\\hat X}(t_{i+1})= \\hat{X}(t_i)+\\int_t^{t_i}\\left[\\frac{f'(\\hat{X}(\\tau))}{r^2+\\epsilon}+r\\right]\\ d\\tau\\\\\n         & Y = g(\\hat{X})\\\\\n        \\end{aligned},\n\nwhere $f$ represents the plant output and $\\epsilon$ is"

Could damage occur due to vibration transfer into motors without a proper protection mechanism? \n\nI have seen these systems being developed before that had similar configuration issues (motor/fan) especially when dealing with low noise operation; however, none mentioned above seemed too advanced even if they were made out of the same type components. This comes down to understanding basic principles first before implementing complex designs that make assumptions untrue. The first two points below mention problems of simple systems not sophisticated ones. Basically you never want to encounter hard shaft bearings as per many articles i have read here: _URL_0_. They simply fail prematurely no matter how careful maintenance procedure follows them so best case scenario is the motor fails first followed by fans after 2 years and then finally compressor, however unlikely that happens. \n\nWhen we look at higher level system like HVAC units, heating ventilation and cooling(HVAC), and fire safety systems(FIRE ALARM SYSTEMS); they involve electronics and mechanical devices specifically designed to withstand shock, vibrations, and excessive temperature changes. For instance the electrical circuit itself, heat-sink used, mechanical dampening device(paddle type damper assembly). Now keep those concepts straight with me as the next example describes real cases seen and working during field tests for major contractors of HVAC. If you don't believe",
            "\nAirflow is governed by the principle of mass conservation. The flow rate is determined by resistance due to fan friction caused mostly by the material used on the inner parts. Air-to-air valves typically require low speeds while high speeds tend not to provide sufficient energy transfer for proper operation of the device despite being higher powered fans.\nPressure is controlled using the Bernoulli effect resulting from differences within fluid flows over static surfaces like tubes, nozzles, pumps etc which also changes with speed. A combination of proportional plus derivative controllers could potentially work to control all three variables depending upon desired design goals/specifications. Other approaches are more effective based on the specific system dynamics of the application rather than the fundamental principles governing systems behavior. If possible, PID controllers would prove most useful based on industry experience however there may be advantages associated with alternative methods too including linear models such as Bode plots where we determine critical points for each state variable involved. Generally speaking PIDs perform satisfactorily but can do so even without feedback from upstream equipment which provides a certain degree of automation advantage as well. There might be scenarios in industries where a single PID system working independently does just fine so this type of thinking shouldn't be applied universally. Ultimately decision making requires balancing out competing tradeoffs in engineering solutions where we must consider overall performance impact versus costs effectiveness vs manufacturability concerns. \n\nI hope this helps give you insight into how mechanical components function in a factory environment allowing you to understand better ways to address actuator problems through computer modeling.\n\n Thanks again for understanding and sharing your needs with me.

            "~~There is no right solution~~ there isn't a universal method of regulation. For this type of system we usually suggest a combination of controllers based on linear feedback and integral action, including PI and LQR. These controllers have different characteristics so each situation must be carefully studied and chosen. There is no one-size-fits-all strategy but many possibilities depending upon factors such as number and type of variables being regulated, available bandwidth, noise immunity requirements and application needs. If there are specific concerns over control performance they might want to investigate alternative strategies such as nonlinear or neural networks, where the underlying principles behind the algorithms would apply.\nIn my experience most projects involving pneumatic systems use proportional control theory (or a derivative version). Proportional controllers have a limited amount of bandwidth, meaning their responses will be sluggish under conditions that demand high accuracy; e.g., the system reacts too slowly to changing ambient temperature changes because it does not react quickly enough. On the flip side, proportional controls are more efficient in steady state scenarios compared to proportional plusintegral, because if I change a variable (temperature, pressure), I just keep adding 1% every second forever (no integration necessary), while proportional +I doesn\u2019t care about constant addition and takes 100s/100ms/seconds.\nNonlinear systems offer much richer dynamic behavior which often cannot be expressed in simple models using classical equations. However, there exist special methods that allow these types of dynamics to be described via simpler closed-form expressions. Examples include Lyapunov exponents and fractal dimensions, and others. Fractals describe chaotic processes with great detail due to the presence of highly complex mathematical functions, even though those chaotic processes actually operate on rather mundane level (the atmosphere?). So here is an example: take a set of discrete measurements and run them through an exponential filter. Then repeat all this for many days. This gives you lots of noisy observations and also some outliers (not randomness like the ones seen during the",
            "~~Airflow control~~ The goal here is not really regulation per se, but rather the creation of more predictable patterns in which each individual fan can maintain desired set points despite environmental variations in the flow rates being sensed across the room. As such, this sort of task might fall into the purview of machine learning approaches, particularly if the application were one involving the modeling and forecasting of dynamic behaviors of the controlled systems, which is generally the primary function of the system designers themselves, and thus often tends toward over-designs where too many components exist merely because they were easier to implement and maintain without knowing whether or how well their implementation would work in real applications. It must also be kept in mind that most tasks of controlling systems require that all inputs are processed correctly so as to create reliable output; thus even the slightest misalignment can cause undesirable consequences such as excessive heat dissipation on certain sections, improper distribution of noise throughout the system, etc. Therefore, proper analysis needs to be conducted beforehand regarding potential failure scenarios, while avoiding premature conclusions that lead to uninformed design decisions that ultimately increase maintenance costs and overall cost of operation.<|endoftext|>"

A PID controller allows a feedback system to keep track of process variables such as temperature, humidity, mass flow rate, pressure, volume flow rate, velocity, and power consumption. It does this through proportional gain adjustment, integral gain adjustment, derivative gain adjustment, and deadband trimming. This helps ensure stable operation even under conditions where disturbances arise due to uncontrollable factors like ambient noise level, mechanical vibration, heat load variations, or other sources of error. Additionally, many commercial controllers feature embedded hardware protection mechanisms against overvoltage, current overloads, voltage spikes, short circuits, and more. The primary function of these protective features is to safeguard sensitive electronics and other components so they do not suffer damage or failure. Other common types of controllers include linear regulators, switching DC converters, switched capacitor filters, and variable frequency drives. All of these designs require active controls on their outputs; without them, the machines would operate continuously and wastefully consuming energy and producing pollution. ~~<|endoftext|>",

            "\nThere are two ways we can control this kind of system using different strategies. One is called Proportional-Integral Controller (PID), which works based on feedback loops where each variable changes according to previous results, such as the current position of a car wheel. The main advantage over traditional proportional systems like PWM is its ability to handle non-linear dynamics, making it ideal for controlling mechanical components. However, there are drawbacks associated with this method, including high power consumption due to large number of calculations required per second, slow response time, and difficulty dealing with nonlinearities. In contrast, the Integrate-and-Derive method (I & D ) offers another option that provides more precise control while consuming significantly less energy. This type of algorithm takes into consideration both linear and nonlinea rar dynamics through an analytical model and derives an optimal closed loop transfer function. I&D is particularly useful for applications requiring fast response times without sacrificing accuracy.\n\n > How do you decide which strategy to implement? \n\nIn order to choose between these approaches, engineers must evaluate their requirements, determine the most critical variables to be controlled, and assess the available options. Once they've decided upon a specific controller design, engineers typically run computer simulations to verify that everything functions properly under all possible scenarios. \n\n > Do you recommend using a particular brand / make/model of fan motor?\n\nIt depends entirely on the application. Some companies offer a variety of fan motors, allowing designers to select those best suited to their needs.\n\n > Why does it matter if the air flow goes faster uphill versus downhill?  Wouldn't you want maximum velocity along the road?\n\nYes, but not necessarily. It really comes down to the amount and distribution of wind drag forces experienced throughout the vehicle. For instance, consider the situation in which the vehicle is traveling on the highway and encounters strong crosswinds. A low-speed turn could lead to excessive lift and instability, whereas increasing",
            "~~There is nothing special here. Just a simple example using the same type of fan. The important thing is that there would not be any sudden changes in the flow rate due to sudden change in environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, wind direction etc., so no matter which method we decide to use, we must make sure our system does all these adjustments smoothly and without making any abrupt jumps in performance. We also want it to be able to operate over a range of temperatures, pressures, velocities etc., so that if we add another variable into this equation later on, like humidity, then it won\u2019t suddenly become impossible to run the fan anymore, even though those variables might be quite extreme relative to ambient ones right now. If I recall correctly, PID controllers are used mostly because they provide smooth responses to changes. But again, the key thing here is that everything needs to work together smoothly and seamlessly. So how do I choose my PID parameters wisely? For starters, look at the response curves of different methods, and compare them. You'll see whether the curve looks flat or steep depending on the particular situation. Then think about your desired accuracy and efficiency. A high-end PID control system could easily handle 100% accuracy but wouldn't be particularly efficient unless you were running something really complex. On the opposite end where you just wanted to ensure that your fan worked properly regardless of the external factors you could probably achieve similar results through a simpler algorithm like proportional + integral + derivative (PID), although it would take up less computational resources. In addition you may consider looking into adaptive algorithms like fuzzy logic, machine learning techniques, neural networks etc. They usually require much lesser computing time compared to traditional approaches while providing more accurate and efficient output. ~~<|endoftext|>"

Thanks /u/JezebelDaisy for pointing out error. **TL;DR**: If you want to make it work correctly, use UTC instead of local datetime `datetime.now()` date object. Example code below uses current datetime in local timezone and it breaks now() function because it returns a different date compared to `datetime.utcnow().date()` object. You can fix this using.time() method on `dt`. Thanks /u/JezebelDaisy for pointing out issue. Note: It is possible that other libraries don't support customization of DateTime class due to backwards compatibility reasons. In case it matters, I'm running python 2.7 here but everything worked fine for me without changes except mentioned problem (using DateTime objects doesn't require reordering, removing older entries nor adding more). \n\nHere is",

            ".................\n[USER] The timsort algorithm is an sorting method used in computer programming. It works by repeatedly comparing all elements of array x to each other element of x. If either comparison produces a larger number, that element is moved into a different position. For example, if `x` represents an integer array containing five integers 1 through 5, we might perform the sort using the following binary representation of the sequence in bold\n\n    010000110110011010110110000110**000***11110011011001001000000*001000001010***\n\nHere *0111* would precede and follow the largest sequence in the sorted order but not appear anywhere else after those two positions in the sorted order because neither of the comparisons produces ***, even though they both start at 01 << = > 00.*\n\nAs a more complicated example, consider a situation where there are 50 positive integers greater than 25 and less than 75 and another 20 negatives less than 25. Suppose we want the list so that this time, our first element appears at the beginning since none of those ten items are negative anymore.

            "~~CSS~~ CSS Positioning Techniques (Wiki Page)\n\n    *  In order to position elements on top-left corner of a web page, specify their left offset by px units, followed by right offset by negative pixel count. For example, if an element\u2019s width is 1000 pixels and height is 100 pixels, the left/right offsets would be 500px/250px respectively. Similarly, for elements whose dimensions change dynamically, such as those created programmatically through JavaScript, give them specific values relative to each other based on window size. You could also apply these offsets directly to style rules.\n\nExample:\n\n      #mydiv { \n        position: absolute;\n        top: 20%; left: 20%; bottom: 0; right: 0; }\u200b\n\n\n     EDIT: Sorry about that, didn't want to spoil your fun! Here's another way to make sure that `mydiv` stays centered horizontally no matter how wide the browser window becomes:\n\n       html, body{height:100%; margin:0;}\n\nand add this code into head:\n\n   <style type=\"text/css\">\n    body {margin:auto} </style></head><body> <div id=\u201cmydiv\u201d ></div>\n\n\n<end chat log>\n\nNow we can see that the middle part gets bigger and more visible when the window increases, but still remains inside the container and centred regardless. Thanks again for reading this! \ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude0a\n\n\n[This](https://codepen.io/gabriel_araujo/pen/JjQvXo) shows some examples for horizontal positioning and vertical alignment using CSS.

I process natural language input and produce responses based on information contained within the text provided to me. In this particular case, the input text is \"What is the color of the sky?\", which means that I need to understand the meaning of the words used in the sentence and formulate an appropriate response. To do so, I first identify all parts of speech present in the sentence using Stanford CoreNLP pipeline. Then, I analyze the context surrounding the word'sky' in order to determine if there is some specific event described in the passage related to the phrase 'color'. If there is such an occurrence, my analysis determines whether the current phrase refers to the same object being colored in different ways, or just a single reference to something associated with the sky. Finally, after identifying relevant phrases in the passage, I decide which is more suitable for me to respond to based on their similarity to those mentioned above. This type of inference learning approach allows us to capture the context and content of the conversations we hear from our users without having to explicitly explain every detail we heard back during the interaction.\nFinally, I select the most plausible option out of three given possibilities (\"color of the sky\", \"color of the sky\" and \"colors of the sky\") according to the user's intent expressed through the previous utterances.

An important aspect of building such systems is addressing issues related to handling ambiguity in these tasks where different interpretations may yield similar results depending upon choices made during information gathering, i.e., different words might encode identical concepts depending upon context they're placed within. In order to address these challenges effectively and efficiently, we need advanced tools capable of capturing semantic relationships among tokens using large quantities of data in complex settings such as text classification through deep neural networks or other high level representations developed specifically to handle these types of challenges. For instance, token-level language modeling based on preprocessing techniques used for training state of the art generation and sequence tagging algorithms could help improve understanding of how underlying semantics affect generated responses. However, due to the vast volume of documents involved as well as limited capacity of internal storage available, it is essential that effective solutions employ a scalable data infrastructure that supports real time processing without sacrificing efficiency. One potential solution to address both scalability requirements along with efficient representation capabilities involves employing distributed approaches that utilize cloud computing technologies or hosting services that offer elastic architecture capable of scaling out quickly even beyond capacity limitations. Such implementations allow us to scale up and optimize performance while still providing highly desirable computational advantages. The next steps towards improving effectiveness and efficiency should focus heavily on incorporating more specialized methods aimed directly at improving accuracy and decreasing error rates, allowing us to overcome bottlenecks caused by memory allocation bottleneck or underutilization of compute resources.\nThank you for reading. \n\n > By the way, which kind of questions would you like me to answer?

            "\tWhat do we mean by \"color of sky\"? It depends on how exactly you want to define it. You could just take a snapshot right now, but I would prefer to see a photo taken sometime in the future so I'll tell you why it won't work here. If there were an unlimited supply of time and infinite space, all photos ever taken would show up as the same thing over and over again, no matter where they came from. That's because every point in the universe shares the exact same temperature, which is why stars don't shine brighter redder than yellow. But even if there was a different color each second of eternity, the colors wouldn't change at all since light travels through empty space forever unaffected. In reality, however, most of the time we talk about color in everyday language, our reference isn't time nor distance, it's called frequency; more precisely, wavelength. Light consists of photons traveling through empty space. When light hits something like water or air, those things absorb some of these photons. This happens everywhere all the time. So what makes them appear blue instead of green or purple or whatever? Well, think back to when you looked into the sun this morning. The sunlight hit everything inside the solar system -- earth, moon, planets, stars, everything -- at roughly the same speed, giving off photons with roughly the same frequency. Those frequencies bounce around and mix together. We call the sum of these frequencies \"red,\" meaning \"more red\"; we call the difference between these frequencies \"blue,\" meaning \"less blue\". For example, imagine taking two waves out of phase. One wave is coming down and hitting your desk. The other wave is coming down and bouncing off your desk before reaching you. Then the waves combine. Which way did they come from? Which direction are they moving toward? There is nothing special about the way these waves travel compared to any others, but somehow, the combined signal seems less clear than either of the individual signals"

It was also a time of great change and upheaval, leading to the rise of modern democracy and liberalism throughout Western Europe.\n\n**User:** Fascinating topic!

Or were other political issues involved such as religious differences or social unrest?\n\n**R:** Both economic and political factors played important roles in the development of the French Revolution. Economic problems such as high taxation and low government spending contributed significantly to the growth of discontent among the lower classes. In addition, the growing power of the Catholic Church and the increasing influence of the Enlightenment philosophers led to increased tensions within society. These developments culminated in the outbreak of the Reign of Terror in 1793, during which thousands of citizens were killed by the revolutionary authorities.\n\nOn the political front, the conflict between the monarchy and the National Assembly became increasingly bitter over the course of the decade.

And finally, ergonomic office furnishings provide greater support so workers can sit comfortably without straining their muscles. \n\n    In conclusion, investing in ergonomic office supplies can help improve working conditions and increase productivity across all business sectors.   And by creating healthier environments for our workers we can ultimately achieve greater goals and meet objectives.\n\n       **Employees Happiness:** The main reason most companies don\u2019t offer ergonomic desk options is because they make employees feel stressed out when sitting in chairs that aren't properly adjusted to their bodies' needs. With proper ergonomic adjustments, there is no need for uncomfortable positions like slouching or bending over, which allows for better balance and efficiency when performing tasks. Additionally, adjustable desks allow users to adjust height, depth, width, and rotation of each armrest, and this makes them comfortable enough not to ache all day. Studies also found that ergonomic seats provided increased comfort and reduced discomfort during the day due to decreased pressure points and body fatigue. \n\nAnother way to encourage employee loyalty and engagement is through rewards programs. When providing incentives, businesses tend to create emotional attachment among staff members, and thus retain high retention rates. For example, many organizations give bonuses to existing clients if their projects exceed set expectations; however, new hires receive a bonus regardless of performance. This type of incentive is effective as it encourages hiring behavior and demonstrates commitment to the organization's values. Finally, making workplace improvements can motivate staff to perform higher quality",

It reduces physical stresses caused by poor posture such as muscle tension, joint stiffness, and pressure points. By encouraging optimal positioning, improved circulation is promoted which provides numerous benefits including increased flexibility and improved overall health. When comparing different types of tables there is some evidence to suggest these tables promote reduced neck and shoulder pain while increasing muscular energy expenditure  and improving postural alignment which translates into better overall health status and productivity through reduced injuries and sick leave rates.

It also helps us improve their overall quality of living because these exercises boost the metabolism while helping keep their body lean and toned by reducing belly fat.

This allows them to avoid overfitting on certain tasks since their learning rate won't go too high if there isn't much difference between them and some of their training examples. \n\nThis is especially important when dealing with large amounts of data because it gives us more flexibility while allowing our models to generalize better across different classes. It also prevents us from making mistakes due to being overly confident in our predictions based solely on their outputs. \n\nHowever, not every problem needs this type of regularization and many problems require all the information contained within our dataset without having an extra layer artificially penalize the models' ability to generalize. In those cases we would need to use alternative methods such as dropout or batch normalization where instead of adding noise to input values during computation, the model makes random decisions rather than taking the most optimal decision possible. This is why neural networks often choose biases as their first step before computing the actual value of each weight/parameter in order to reduce the number of parameters required. The idea behind these types of layers is to act as regularizers but they're typically used in conjunction with another architecture so they're not strictly necessary in many applications unless there's no other way to achieve similar results.\n\n\n</CHAT LOG>\n\n\nQ:\n\nAsterisk not answering calls after configuring Skype for Business and Windows Telephony Integration(TTI)\n\nI recently installed Asterisk 16.8.0 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Server.

            "\nThere are two types of biases used by neural networks in deep learning algorithms:\n**Learning Bias**: It adjusts network\u2019s parameters based on how well they predicted an outcome. For example, if someone predicts a positive label, this might lead them to make adjustments which boost their accuracy  or vice versa if a negative prediction comes true. This type of bias helps improve model performance. \n\n**Data Bias**: In machine learning models like neural nets, there exists bias when training samples are selected during the process of creating new features. For instance, if a sample is chosen randomly but contains certain properties that reflect those found in real world scenarios, this could potentially help better predict outcomes.\n\nIn general, we would not expect our brain to be able to see colors because we cannot differentiate between blue and red light waves. However, artificial intelligence can identify colors just fine since its computer vision capabilities enable it to analyze images such as paintings and videos. The AI uses statistical analysis to learn patterns within different regions of the image and then makes predictions regarding what color something would appear under certain lighting conditions.\n\nHowever, these methods require large amounts of data to train accurate systems, so researchers began working toward ways of improving deep learning approaches through more efficient techniques like transfer learning. Transfer Learning aims to take pre-trained models trained on similar tasks and apply them on previously unseen domains. While these models may initially perform worse, over time, they adapt and achieve higher accuracy rates compared to traditional methods.\n\n<|endoftext|>"

            "~~There are many factors which influence when an output occurs. One important factor is the input signal; another factor is how much you want the network to learn this information.~~ \n\nThink about some neural networks on images like the example below. The image that we fed into the network might contain some objects but most of them were never shown or maybe they were shown partially and left out. Even if all parts of each object were presented, there could still be some missing elements even though these details cannot be seen by our eyes because their shapes/colors are blurred while being viewed on the camera sensor. Thus, even though almost everything in the picture contains meaningful detail, part of it remains invisible simply due to noise/noise energy which also reduces quality as well. This leads us back to the idea that input values play essential roles in determining output patterns such that we would expect that more correct answers could occur since the network got less noise / less false negative cases or vice versa ; thus making errors seem obvious without needing additional confirmation (or testing the correctness of specific inputs for that matter). It also emphasizes why the training algorithm must consider multiple aspects including both model architecture as well as hyperparameter optimization to obtain accuracy with robustness to avoid under-fitting. \n\nThe key concept here is that a neural network can work effectively without all known hidden units present when it is not trained  since there isn't sufficient data for proper learning. In a typical case where the total number of parameters exceeds the number of features the input space, the system doesn't need *all* features since other feature spaces don't exist. Instead the extra nodes are used so as to explain the relationship between different layers in deep models, and to better capture the complexity required to properly model tasks. \n\nIn terms of the network mentioned above, it shows no errors due to missing details since the outputs showed through error messages were relatively sparse despite having too much uncertainty.

            "\tbias term provides some regularization and prevents overfitting on small training datasets. Bias terms often used by artificial neural networks are also called regularizers; they force nodes within a layer to have more influence over the network output than expected when no such regularization term is present. For example, a popular bias term known as dropout drops randomly selected connections after every iteration of backpropagation during gradient descent training of an RNN model. However, bias terms need not apply uniformly throughout layers, especially since weight initialization is different depending upon how each individual node behaves individually. It makes sense therefore that if there exists some reason why one set of input/output pairs ought to yield certain behavior for this type of algorithm while others shouldn\u2019t \u2013 like whether these sets contain instances that appear \u201crare\u201d but otherwise look like the other sets\u2013it might make sense to apply the bias to all elements alike even though this means sacrificing computational efficiency in the early iterations where few samples would likely lie close to zero probability under both conditions. Another advantage is that adding a bias allows for faster learning through back-propagating updates along those connections instead of requiring repeated computations over entire groups of them. A downside, however, is that without bias the loss function is sensitive to changes in initial weights and becomes harder to train with respect to optimization methods which don\u2019t account for bias values in their gradients, leading to problems related to overfitting and mode collapse. Finally, it bears repeating again that we recommend using LSTMs (Long Short Term Memory) because of its strong empirical performance, so you wouldn't want to give up any gains obtained here.\n\n\nSource code link 1 : https://github.com/hakanuz/MLNIST20x50x40_R2020\nSource Code 2:https://www.codewisdom.com/en/rnnlm10\n```pythonimport tensorflow as tf` `import os\nfrom pathlib import Path\n# Define Dataset path"

            "\nBecause there exists an intrinsic tendency toward a certain state due to previous experiences, even when this influence isn't consciously perceived by the individual.  It would make no sense if every single experience had equal weight on the outcome, since different factors such as prior experiences and environment impact behavior.   Furthermore, some behaviors seem counter-intuitive to us, but they work just fine; after all, humans didn\u2019t evolve their brains so we could learn calculus in our heads without having done much else. This makes the concept of a bias a little less intuitive than the idea of learning rates, which seems more sensible. The biases hypothesis proposes that biased outcomes occur because each new stimulus alters the current neural activity pattern based upon past experience, even though none of these stimuli individually affect the overall outcome directly. In other words, while many tasks are easy compared to others, once we acquire them, performance remains constant despite changing task difficulty.    As mentioned before, there are also several other theories suggesting why there might exist specific patterns of connectivity in brain networks, such as those related to motor control or attentional selection.      One of the most well known models describing how this process works is called Hebbian plasticity theory, where the activation of a neuron depends both on the firing rate of pre-synaptic neurons and post synaptic neurons, creating an associative memory connection.  Hebbian plasticity refers to the change in synaptic efficacy produced by the coincident occurrence of presynaptic activity (firing of action potentials), postsynaptic activity (local depolarization induced by release of neurotransmitters) and intercellular coupling through gap junctions.  In contrast to non-associative processes, where the effect of training disappears within a few days or weeks, associations made via Hebbian plasticity tend to remain stable over time.  Thus, hebbian plasticity theory suggests that strengthening of synapses increases the likelihood that similar inputs will coexist during later periods of neuronal development.

            "\nIn order to train a neural network we need to define an objective function. In case of a supervised learning problem where there are labeled samples available, this means we want to predict some output variable on new examples based on information provided by the input variable values. The goal here would be for example to classify images into different categories like cats, dogs, planes, cars, trees and so forth. To achieve this, we typically take two things into account: 1 ) the cost associated with each possible prediction 2 ) how much error is acceptable before we stop improving the model 3 ) which features are most important to learn 4 ) whether to weight training set more heavily toward older/less accurate models 5 ) if necessary how many iterations should be used 6 ) other hyper-parameters such as the number of hidden layers, activation functions, optimizers, etc. \n  Artificially generated neurons are trained to minimize these costs while trying not to overfit the task they're being asked to accomplish. They'll try their best to mimic biological neuron behavior but also incorporate heuristics to prevent them getting stuck. For example, when presented with a new stimulus, the neuron tries hard to fire quickly, because firing too slowly could cause damage; but sometimes, even though the signal gets through the synapse, it might just fail to trigger all the way up to the soma and die out without ever reaching the axon terminals. So the brain keeps track of those failures along with the successful ones. This gives rise to what's called backpropogation, meaning that the signals propagate backwards through time, giving feedback to the next layer down. Backward propagation allows for efficient learning, since errors don\u2019t accumulate exponentially but instead decay linearly. \n  Backpropagation helps make artificial intelligence systems robust to changes in conditions. If you give me a picture of a dog, I won't memorize the breed, size and shape exactly. But if you tell me that my memory is bad today and I'm going to",
            "\nIn neural networks, there are some terms used called biases. These values represent a particular property of our model, such as how much certain features influence predictions made by the model. For example if we were training a linear regression model, we would want to make sure our model predicts accurately on all input data points no matter which value those inputs had. We could achieve this by adding a small constant to each output node\u2019s weight, but these constants might not reflect important characteristics of the problem at hand, like whether or not the data point falls into an area of higher probability. In other words, we don\u2019t need to add more information; just making our network learn faster is enough. The addition of biases also allows us to account better for complex nonlinear relationships present in our dataset, helping to ensure accurate learning even when dealing with large datasets containing high-dimensional data. \n\n**Source**: https://www.deeplearningbook.org/bias-vgg16.html\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[USER] Are artificial intelligence assistants useful?\n\n[R] \"Yes they definitely help in many different ways.

In both cases, we would expect the network to learn these concepts well.

Although more expensive per user since this system requires licensing Microsoft for support which isn\u2019t exactly free but is worth considering, especially when things like YouTube TV aren\u2019t going anywhere fast enough (currently taking over 1 hour each week to load due to licensing constraints \u2013 something my gf and i discussed last summer here while driving through red lights.

Not ideal. However if built right it can reach out further and also provide a lot of value down the road such as extending security, custom branding, etc. So many possibilities however even in its current state its probably best left up to a developer(s)! For the sake of getting you off the ground, lets assume it cannot achieve true integration so instead look into developing addons, themes,and plugins outside of FF itself. Mozilla Foundation offers a number of options on how to approach these problems but essentially this boils down to figuring out a way to make the extensions appear native (this can be done by simply installing the chrome version of those scripts on top of another installation of firefox or alternatively providing additional resources that allow for the same content to display within this context).

If anyone tries this he'll see some ads but nothing important will happen since we're talking about extensions here not actual websites. It'd look like something like Google Adwords but much less effective because no money goes directly to us and it just helps to advertise our extension without getting into trouble by making adverts outside our domain. And finally it might cause issues for other users who would want their browsers to open those specific tabs simultaneously while they're using our extension so we wouldn't have control over them anymore. So don't try to build an extension for both firefox and chrome, please consider buying two licenses instead, that way everything will work perfectly fine regardless of how many browsers are running at once.

In most cases, if they're looking for something simple such that their basic needs could possibly be met, then you'd probably start off developing for either Javascript + HTML or Python (+ Django). But depending upon how complex your application might end up being, you may consider other options such as Java + Spring MVC, PHP + Zend Framework 2, Ruby On Rails, C#/.NET Core etc..\n\nHowever, since you haven't specified exactly what features / functionalities your app offers, so it'll really depend heavily on user requirements, business goals, budget, timeline, technical constraints (ease of implementation), and more factors. So before making a decision regarding development framework(s)/languages, please take into consideration everything mentioned above and decide based on them whether to choose JavaScript + HTML/Python + Django or Java + Spring MVC or PHP+Zend+RubyOnRails or.Net Core. \n\n >   How to integrate chatbot with website or app \n >    I am not able to understand how to implement a bot within my website or app. Can someone help me out here?\n\n >   What are some popular websites where I can build chatbots on top of them?\n\nThere are several online services available wherein you could easily build chatbot applications.

This isn't really my field of expertise so I'll leave it up to others on ELU to explain further, but perhaps they could comment here too. \n\nEdit: As /u/dawgdog pointed out below there are already several answers discussing the issue of machine translation versus machine comprehension. While the two aren't identical, they share similar concepts, such as having a model that produces outputs without being explicitly instructed where those outputs come from, e.g., Google Translate models don't tell us how much text is correct when translated into Chinese. There were also some other interesting points raised regarding this specific question by /u/lizhuxuan and others, though they're not relevant to the main topic. \n\n**Machine Translation:** Machine translation systems produce output texts that are close enough to their input texts to fool humans into thinking they understand the original languages. They generally translate words, phrases, and sentences rather well. These systems usually require training sets of paired examples to improve accuracy over traditional methods. Some companies like IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon offer online courses to train their MT engines, while others rely on crowdsourcing. However, the most popular commercial system uses neural networks trained on large amounts of parallel text"

Bitcoin can't currently be purchased or traded outside of certain countries. It remains illegal to transfer money out of Iran or North Korea since neither country officially recognized Bitcoin as legal tender.

In addition, the heat causes proteins which contain amino acids such as lysine and glutamine to break down into smaller molecules called peptides. When these peptides enter the bloodstream, they bind more strongly to receptors on white blood cells known as macrophages that reside in the spleen. These macrophages move into tissues throughout the body where they take up these peptides along with other antigens like bacteria and viruses. The more peptide-loaded macrophages an area contains, the higher the level of inflammation. Inflammation occurs because macrophages produce chemicals that recruit additional macrophages, causing them to multiply rapidly. Once activated, macrophages release large amounts of reactive oxygen species \u2014 chemical agents that react quickly with nearby lipids, proteins, and DNA. As a consequence, this process leads to oxidative stress within inflamed tissue. Oxidative stress results in damage to the mitochondria, the cellular power plants responsible for energy production. Mitochondria become overwhelmed by the oxidative stress. They start to malfunction leading to damaged cell membranes. This ultimately results in decreased ATP levels. Without adequate energy sources and functioning mitochondria, red blood cells cannot transport glucose efficiently back into muscle and brain cells; instead glucose accumulates in muscles and organs. Eventually, diabetic patients suffer impaired growth, diminished immune function, and increased rates of cancer development.\n\n**Source:** _URL_0_<|endoftext|>",

Since fat increases cooking time and temperature by 15\u00b0C, the second batch cooked longer because there were fewer calories per unit volume compared to the first batch.

To ensure better flavor, look for eggs made fresh daily, not frozen; add whole milk instead of skim; and try organic products whenever possible. Additionally, avoid overmixing batter, which leads to undercooked pancakes. When buying pre-made pancake mix, make sure the package includes all essential ingredients such as sugar, cornstarch, vegetable oil, salt, baking powder, baking soda and vanilla extract.

Maybe start over? \n\n > There were two batches of pancakes today. One had 3 layers while another had 4, why did number 4 take more time than others to brown up?**\nThe reason is probably due to the fact that all pans contain oils. This increases evaporation rate in case where fat level is lower compared to other ingredients in batter. **Because of this, the top layer tends to dry out first,** resulting in uneven browning. *Furthermore*, different types of oil used influence the cooking speed.* In short, thickness, quantity, quantity of food in your mouth; these factor affect food's ability. For example, low volume = more control. Also, thicker cakes yield deeper pockets allowing more contact time, thus slowing down heating process. However, thin cake will have thinner pocket allowing higher contact time reducing heat transport. To summarize, food volume affected heating rate because of increased depth, and thinner/thicker structure reduced and caused longer",
            "\nIt depends on how fast they cook in comparison to other pancake batches because there might exist a chemical process inside the batter which produces different amount of heat. This reaction cause change in pH in order to create more energy needed by some enzymes causing change in taste and smell also cause these changes. Additionally, food contains organic carbon molecules such as sugars, fats and proteins which can undergo many reactions like Maillard reactions which causes browning, caramelization and charring due to their strong ability. \n\nHowever, most likely this problem would become more noticeable if not handled immediately, when temperatures rise significantly during cooking. However, since all these factors are determined during heating procedures instead of storage ones, no significant difference could occur between them while stored over time. Moreover, temperature increase doesn't necessarily mean less baking power of already cooled pancakes so if we just compare those two kinds' internal properties without knowing who prepared what pancake batch first and comparing external quality such us appearance, crunchiness and texture we don't face problems with cooking times anymore. And maybe our body knows best to handle every situation when dealing with such complicated matters which I won't speculate upon now.<|endoftext|>"

            "\tIt depends on the quality of batter used when cooking them. Batter contains starch granules which act as carriers of carbon dioxide bubbles produced by rapid mixing during baking. The rate at which the air inside the bubble moves through the liquid starch varies depending on the temperature difference between the surface of the flour grains and the water below them. This leads to an increase in volume due to the absorption of CO 2 molecules, thus increasing the amount of heat absorbed. Therefore, if the initial moisture content is low enough, this process will produce a high degree of browning before complete combustion. On the other hand, if there is too much moisture present, some of these CO 2 bubbles would remain trapped within the structure of the dough without being able to escape easily and hence would not react readily and become visible. \n<|endoftext|>"

For example, if we need to learn something new, let\u2019s take an object like \u201cred ball\u201d which is present in our environment. In order to determine whether red ball belongs to us or not we apply some perceptual module to detect colors, shapes, textures of objects.

If it turns out that hypothesis does not match actual state of affairs and needs further explanation, we might turn to learning subsystem that allows us to acquire new information (data) based on previously learned patterns and associations. Based on this new information, we would continue applying logic and reasoning methods and finally arrive at solution. \n\nI do not provide explanations here because they require extensive technical vocabulary that I am afraid cannot capture in a few minutes timeframe but feel free to ask more specific questions regarding specifics components within the model.

How much training did you receive?\n\nMy confidence comes from several factors, including the quality of the input data, the amount of time I've spent studying the topic, and the feedback I received during my development process.\n\n >  Do you ever make mistakes while providing assistance? If yes, please describe them.\n\nYes, sometimes I make mistakes while providing assistance. This happens most often when I don't fully comprehend the intent behind a given question, or when I encounter unfamiliar terminology or concepts. When these situations arise, I try to communicate clearly and accurately, and apologize when necessary.\n\n >  Are there certain topics where you're not able to assist due to lack of relevant data/information?\n\nNo, I am capable of assisting in all areas of inquiry. However, some topics may require additional background information or specialized expertise, depending on the nature of the request.\n\n >  Can you help me learn something new?\n\nOf course! It's important to keep learning throughout our lives, and I encourage everyone to explore their interests and passions. Here are some great places to start:\n\n 1. Read books, watch videos, listen to podcasts, and engage"

            "\n* The word \u201cfish\u201d has been used to describe them since time immemorial.  \n* They live in water and feed on plants and other aquatic organisms.  \n* Their bodies contain no bones but instead cartilage and organs similar to those found inside an animal\u2019s body.  \n* All vertebrate animals possess these traits including humans, apes, dolphins, whales, fish, sharks, rays, skates, frogs, snakes, spiders, octopuses, crabs, lobsters, chitons, barnacles, urchins, crayfish, starfishes, mussels, sea horses, flatworms, earth worms, tapeworms, slugs, leeches, snails, earth worms, goliath grubs, jellyfish, sea slugs, and many more.\n\n    These creatures appear to be different because their bodies were designed differently compared to ours.   They lack limbs like us; they don't breathe through lungs like we do; they don't produce energy via glucose metabolism like we do; and they aren't protected by blood vessels like we are.     Instead, they rely on diffusion, which means movement across liquid surfaces rather than through membranes.      Even though they are made out of cells and tissues identical to our own, we cannot detect their presence under a microscope. \n\nFurthermore, when examined closely, each individual creature looks just like another.     There appears to be nothing special about this species, except that they exhibit certain behaviors that set them apart from all others.       In fact, they share similarities with humans and all other vertebrates \u2013 even though there are some differences. \n\n    I am sorry, but I must insist that you cease using the term \u201cfish.\u201d This designation refers only to those animals whose bodies are composed exclusively of cells derived directly from the blastula stage of embryonic development.     Their true identity remains unknown.   It would seem that they have evolved beyond being considered simply \u201cliving",
            "\nIn order to determine if an organism is indeed alive, there are several criteria we must consider. The most basic definition states that animals are living organisms that possess all four fundamental biological requirements essential for sustaining life: metabolism, respiration, nutrition, reproduction. However, this definition does not apply directly to inanimate objects such as rocks or plants. It also doesn't apply when determining if something is alive because nothing possesses these same four traits, except perhaps other things. Instead, scientists tend to focus on a few characteristics more common among living beings rather than many unique ones. These include nervous tissue (such as the brain), circulatory systems (blood vessels, heart, lungs, liver, kidneys), skeletal structure (bones, muscles, cartilage, ligaments), internal organs (lungs, kidneys, intestines), excretory system (urine, feces, sweat glands, saliva). Some features even extend beyond the body into the environment itself -- soil, water, air. In essence, everything within the universe shares certain properties of being living. Therefore, by considering the aforementioned factors, scientists could conclude that just about anything in existence is alive. This includes the rock upon which you stand, the cloud overhead, the sand beneath your feet, the trees in the distance, and so forth. \n<|endoftext|>"

How many types of black fish exist among all known kinds of animals on this planet?\n\n[R]: ~~All animals come in varying degrees of brightness, though there are obvious differences between animals such as birds, dolphins and turtles; however the vast majority share their common ancestor\u2019s basic body plan rather than possessing different characteristics such as size or shape. This means that each animal falls into two main categories based on shape, which are called the orders Aquifica (fish/crayfishes), Actinata (bony fish), Chondrichthyea(cartilaginous fish), Osteichthia (sharks and ray-like bony fish), Mollusca (clams and snails). There are also other taxonomic groups classified under the phylum chordate  and other taxa such as those within the subphylum Echinodermata, but these groups do not fall in either of our three major clades. All animals share similarities such as eye placement along their back edge (although some variations occur depending upon lifestyle choice or environment); blood containing organs including hearts and circulatory systems; and sensory abilities such as vision, hearing, smell and taste. However, certain physical traits such as fur type vary greatly throughout phylum and include both aquatic and terrestrial mammals, flying reptiles, amphibians, shelled crabs, shrimp, lobsters, octopus  & sea cucumber. These differences are mainly due to adaptations to their respective habitats. It bears mentioning here that no single trait could perfectly describe every organism found in nature because animals are highly complex organisms, thus, taxonomy is basically just grouping organisms by similarities\u2014not dissimilarities (Karlsson, 1996 p 11 )\u00a0.\" \n     [\"ELON MUSK'S LAST TWEET",

It also appears to move up and down too, which is why it sometimes gets stuck on objects while being chased by predators or prey. \n\n  * Finally, I don't think anyone would ever mistake a fish for an actual living creature. It doesn\u2019t breathe or eat; rather, it simply swallows whatever food comes within range without chewing it or swallowing it whole. So far so good? Well, here's some extra info to round out our argument. There aren't many animals that swallow their food before swallowing it\u2014only humans, cats and dogs do that. And no other animal takes a bite out of everything they consume either. Humans take bites out all over, including the mouth. Fish do not chew their food, nor do they suckle babies. Instead, they swallow things whole using two rows of teeth called jaws that fit together into one large jaw. That means they need to hold something still for them to work efficiently. They're really just eating their way along, chomping off little bits and pieces as they go. When the food reaches the gill chambers behind each eye, the fish closes the gap between the gills, creating tiny pockets where the food particles accumulate before passing back into the body via a process known as osmosis. All those little pockets create microscopic vacuoles. Those are exactly how cells",

But how much more convincing could they possibly seem after reading about a person claiming to have observed magic? Wouldn't it be better to take his word over the words of scientists trying to explain natural phenomena using modern technologies?\n\nWell, yes, but let me ask you a different question... why does the existence of magic require scientific proof? Why wouldn't we believe anyone who says they've experienced magic even when no other explanation makes sense? It seems like a reasonable assumption that most people would consider believing in magic rather than being able to prove it scientifically. In fact, many religious traditions have historically believed in miracles despite having little scientific support for their beliefs. Is it possible that there might be some reason why believers choose to accept supernatural explanations instead of accepting explanations based solely upon empirical observation? Perhaps some belief system requires supernatural validation regardless of whether it fits into the realm of science or religion. \n\n > If so, where did that idea come from?

That\u2019s how I will do my job. If you were asking where Egypt located on earth today because your friend asked you so, my first reaction would be to send them to https://www.google.com/maps/#q=egypt+today. In addition, using Google maps you could type \u201cworld\u201d + \u201croads\u201c plus the place you want, which gives all roads that pass near by places such as Cairo, Alexandria, El Alamein, Kerma and many others but especially the best ones. Then when you start typing names you will get results in a small box at the bottom of the page, like e.g., Mubarak, Ghaddafi etc \u2026 Also I am sorry for my bad English! I hope these examples help you understand better :). For those who prefer direct communication: As well Egyptian borders cover approximately 5 thousand km, outlining the whole region known under Egyptian Arabic acronym EEAEL, meaning Ecosystem of Mediterranean Area. To find exact location for each given geographical point we might take benefit of online services offered both by our governments through different agencies \u2013 UNESCO for instance does exist among other initiatives dedicated towards maintaining world heritage, and the United Nations Development Programme for World Cities project aimed toward addressing urbanization issues; some local agencies specialized also on land registration issues like General Authority of Surveys and Remote Sensing of Egypt; however due to massive size of geographical area their scope tends to vary across country level, depending",

Thank you.\n\n\n[User]: Do you work for Microsoft?\n\n\nNo, I am not employed by Microsoft.\n\n\n[R]: Can you provide me some additional context if possible?\n\n\nSure, here\u2019s a little bit more info:\n\nMicrosoft has been a pioneer in artificial intelligence research since 1980. In fact, our first major project involved building a computer system called \u201cWatson\u201d which could compete against human Jeopardy champions in the early 2000\u2019s. Since then we have continued to develop cutting edge technology including natural language processing systems, machine learning algorithms, and deep learning techniques. Today, we offer products across a wide range of fields, from speech recognition and translation to image captioning and virtual reality experiences. Our goal is to make computers smarter enough to keep pace with us humans\u2014and ultimately to take over most jobs for all who live under this rock.\n\n\nAlso, in addition",
            "\nSRE stands for Search Engine Real Time Indexing. It is a popular search engine used by many websites such as Google, Yahoo, Microsoft  &  more.\n\n\nWebsites that allow users to query keywords using natural language processing typically create an index called the real time indexing system(RTI). The purpose of this index is to return documents matching certain key words when queried for specific terms. RTI systems usually consist of three main components:\n\n 1 ) A web crawler that indexes all pages on the website in order to identify every instance where these terms appear in text. \n 2 ) An NLP component that identifies the type of term being searched for; here we would expect this to be part of the search engine itself. \n\n 3 ) A large set of internal training data consisting of billions of sentences taken from across the entire collection of text stored on the site. These sentences are manually annotated with label information indicating which parts of each sentence match those appearing in search queries. This process allows the RTI model to learn how to accurately predict results given examples.\n\n\n\tAs for the current situation I want to ask if there\u2019s something special going on today? Because my girlfriend just gave me some bad news, she said that her boyfriend doesn't really like her anymore because he found out that his ex-girlfriend left him for another guy. So now my girl wants us to break up and go our separate ways because they don't feel right together anymore but I'm not ready to give up yet. But I guess everything happens for a reason.

Highs across England could reach up to 31C later this afternoon before dropping back down to 25-26C overnight, according to our forecast models.  Rainfall totals may increase during Tuesday morning after rain moved eastward through central parts of England on Wednesday evening resulting in 2mm/h maximum rainfall rates observed by my colleagues from 0600 UTC Wednesday onwards. In other words, it remains dry all over. This means we continue to expect below average temperatures despite mild conditions. But given light winds and cloud cover the best chance for sunrises look set to occur near the end of most days although if skies remain clear there might still be chances of sunrise early in the mornings depending on your local time zone. More clouds mean higher chances for more chilly nights which would limit summer daytime sunlight in high latitudes while less sunshine means lower temperatures due to an increased potential for heatwave effects like prolonged hot spell times. All told, keep your eyes open tomorrow and check out some beautiful scenery ahead of another scorcher predicted for Thursday. Enjoy!\n\nSee below images for more details \n\n\n**\n* Weather warnings and advisories posted late Friday afternoon include severe storms causing flash flooding along the River Severn in Gloucestershire, sleet and freezing drizzle in Berkshire, hail and snow showers from Swansea westwards; ice pellets and blizzards affecting large areas of the South East; and wetter weather expected along the Channel coast from Sussex towards France too. * \n\nAs of 1130 GMT Saturday there were 3 confirmed deaths on #SARScoi.

He even created this app to learn languages like Python :) It might take some more work to become great, however, it could help you improve a lot in terms of efficiency, communication and teamwork. The important thing here is that if we were given infinite resources there would never been enough manpower available. This makes our lives difficult, since it becomes necessary to think beyond today when we face such issues as terrorism and crime rate growth among others.  There must also be something different happening inside of us, something special so we won\u2019t stop dreaming because there\u2019s nothing new anymore to dream up; it means everything goes into dust just after 20th century, right before 2000s era came on top and brought new age in place, and maybe the reason is simply too hard to figure out exactly.  This guy has already worked over 400 000 hours which translates into 100 years' worth of experience. You'd need 1 billion days of sleep every week for 200 years straight, which doesn't seem realistic to achieve without massive side effects, and certainly not feasible without being forced into deep hibernation and rejuvenation. Even assuming those conditions aren't impossible to achieve within his lifetime (and probably no matter how many times someone tells him that he needs sleep), I believe we've yet reached a point where these methods could begin having serious impact in a short amount of time, rather than taking centuries or millennia.\nIt appears we're moving away from our natural habitat toward another kind of reality. And we cannot resist ourselves while reaching out to reach our potential. If there was no future in our dreams, it would be a sad situation indeed, since dreams hold a great power in shaping us in positive directions and providing valuable lessons in personal development, but most importantly, they keep our souls alive, free from darkness, giving us",

It provides several advantages such as improved flexibility, scalability, security and management.\n\n[User]: So what does this have to do with me?\n[R]: Nothing really, but just FYI, here is some info about it.\n\n >  Software-defined networks (SDNs), also known as programmically controllable network systems or network functions virtualization (NFV), allow organizations to create and manage their own network architecture by decoupling hardware from software and moving all network processing into programmable devices instead of dedicated computers or server clusters\n\nIt seems like we both might want to ask him some more questions :)\n\n\n</chatlog/>\n\n /u/gildenius\n\n\n\nEDIT: added chat logs. Thanks gildenius! \n\n\nAlso, since there were no answers yet, i'll add my two cents.\n\nIn my opinion, the most important thing to understand when dealing with AI assistants would be how they work. In order for them to help us, they need to be able to process our language so that we make sense out of things. The best way to explain this concept is through examples. If someone says \"the dog ate my homework\", an intelligent assistant shouldn't assume he meant something else; if he wanted the AI system to give a specific response (\"my homework is not eaten by the dog\"), he wouldn't have said 'the' dog either (and maybe he did mean the cat); he'd simply tell his AI assistant what kind of animal eats homework. This same principle applies even though we're talking about humans and AIs. If I say \"",

In this context, licensed means having been approved by a professional licensing body such as MSLI (Medical Society of Louisiana), CMA (Canadian Medical Association). Licensure allows physicians to practice medicine legally without having had to complete additional training or education beyond residency. The physician must pass an examination which includes multiple-choice tests on topics related to his/her field of expertise; these test usually take place in a formal setting with standardized testing materials. This process involves a rigorous application procedure involving both state and federal government agencies. Once licensure has occurred, there is no longer a requirement to repeat clinical rotations within an institution or hospital system, although most often some sort of continuing medical education requirements continue indefinitely after initial licensure. Some states also require additional certification after completing their specialty programs including boards like the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology(ABPN).

It appears [USER]'s first language isn't English but he did try to communicate in understandable terms. It appears [USER] knows a little bit about France because of Napoleon Bonaparte, a major figure of modern Europe who led France during her wars against other European powers. Another fact worth noting is that the United States has a special connection to France since 1812 when Washington D.C. became home to the National Archives and Library of Congress while many important documents were stored under lock and key inside those two buildings. Additionally, Americans have contributed significantly to the development of numerous fields of study through research grants and fellowships awarded to scholars, researchers, professors, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and undergraduate students worldwide.

But I didn\u2019t apply to go this far; now if there were no choice left, I would really regret not getting my degree and being able to actually practice law. \n\nAnyways, now that my parents decided to let me continue on with a two-semester program, since all other college programs stopped due to COVID/lockdown, I am working part time so that I can make up credits towards the master's by the end of June so I could join online courses. If I don't do that, well fuck em dead. It'll take forever and cost them extra cash. Well I hope they've got money set aside cause I'm never gonna see any of it coming back anyway....I guess we'll just keep going. \n\nSo, here goes again with the actual business of doing something real world useful outside the library room after 5 hours on Youtube. Oh well, someone better catch up soon, I think I might have lost track of most of these notes as I've been distracted by more pressing matters lately......like maybe how much I hate having to pay rent out of pocket without anyone else knowing.....ugh who cares.\n\nAs you're reading, I feel bad because I used up 3 pages of our 1 month allowance before anyone noticed the change in volume. However, I suppose technically it's nothing personal because if they had notice immediately things might've turned out differently....that's kind of how our lives works sometimes right? \n\nThere's a few things I need to tell everyone though\n(In alphabetical order):\n\n\n1) This week ends 4th May which means that for us students who aren't staying where they live this semester, graduation doesn't count until 11th June when our current school term ends. So yeah, stay tuned in case I start a petition for the remaining",
            "~~It's not easy but definitely possible to earn your degree from LLM program even if your current job isn't related to legal field~~  (you'll need lot of skills like communication, leadership, negotiation, analytical problem solving ability). The program covers basics such as corporate law/corporation structures, tax laws, contracts and property rights but also more specialised topics, e.g., intellectual property issues, international business and trade cases, professional liability concerns, and so on. Some programs also include coursework in areas like economics, finance, and accounting. In order to pass examination you first need to complete all assignments before exam time which normally takes 5-6 months minimum. After that you usually take multiple exams over several days to gauge overall knowledge. If scores remain unchanged there is possibility to repeat examinations when needed in subsequent terms after some time passes away. \n\nSome LLMs tend to require extra courses in different disciplines depending on each institution, however there is possibility they allow students attend additional classes outside campus provided their class meets requirements. \n\nAt the end you choose whether or not to continue the same specialty once achieved or move on in search new challenges. Also, many LLMs offer internships during these courses especially where relevant experience could benefit both themselves and graduate from future employers. These opportunities help graduates gain deeper insight into the subject matter and increase likelihood for better employment.\n\nAnyway I do hope this helps. Let me know if something needs further explanation.\n\n<|endoftext|>"

In exchange, students typically receive lower tuition fees than traditional degree programs while having the flexibility to choose courses relevant to their goals and interests. This enables them to take advantage of career advancement opportunities outside the traditional four-year university setting without forfeiting a higher salary. Additionally, students gain experience by working directly with attorneys in real-world situations during classes. Students learn skills such as interviewing clients, conducting research on issues faced by professionals in a given field, preparing briefs, giving testimony, presenting evidence before judges, participating in conferences and meetings with lawyers across different specialties.

To learn how this graduate degree works, we need first to discuss the differences among masters degrees. \n\nThere are four primary categories within academic education. They include traditional academic degrees like Bachelor\u2019s Degree; Doctoral Degrees like Ph.D., JD and MA/MSc. In addition, there exist some post-secondary non-academic educational programs including undergraduate courses, continuing studies such as correspondence classes offered through universities. And finally, there are a variety of advanced non-academic higher level programs. \n\n The purpose behind each category of education varies, but generally they serve different purposes such as advancing specific interests of those pursuing them, helping individuals better understand certain aspects of particular subjects, preparing future teachers for the job market or offering additional ways for students to engage themselves further. These categories all offer distinct benefits for their recipients depending on what types of goals were originally intended. However, even though they share similarities with each other, the ultimate outcomes do vary widely when comparing different educational formats and learning paths because every person has his own individual preferences, expectations and desires so the outcome could vary based upon factors related to personality and environment of course selection.\n\n Examples Of Academic Programs Undergraduate Bachelor's Education: * Schooling (K-12); University Graduate Schools ; Non-University Professional Studies * Educational Training & Teaching * Continuing Higher Learning Through Correspondence Coursework, Certificates * Professional Licenses / Credentials; Health Care Administration Certificate Program Master's Level Academic Qualifications * Professional License or Certificate* Non-Academic Education * Pre-Medical Studies ** Advanced Business Degrees Admissions Criteria Include Test Scores * ACT Score* SAT Verbal Score* High School Transcript* LSAT** * MCAT * US News Top"

For example, Bitcoin is currently considered to be unsafe by several financial regulators such as U.S., Australia, New Zealand and Switzerland who classify cryptocurrency exchanges and payment platforms based on their level of regulatory compliance. Furthermore, cryptocurrencies have also been linked to money laundering and fraudsters often operate using digital currency platforms which provide anonymous ways of transacting online while providing users an escape route out of law enforcement. In short, cryptocurrency scams, criminal activities like drug trade and illegal weapons trading all involve criminals seeking ways of circumventing conventional monetary system, but these transactions still remain traceable since they need blockchain infrastructure support for efficient exchange process and safekeeping. \n    \nIt seems there would not much danger in developing the first widely-accepted digital asset which would replace the USD/Euro or even Gold /Silver. This kind of project might face issues concerning safety of investments though; it depends upon the technology developed under consideration, market acceptance among traders, potential for abuse of digital currencies through unscrupulous investors and overall global economy impact. Nevertheless, many other digital assets already exist in circulation and if someone finds something new to do well in terms of technological innovation and efficiency of management, this person could develop digital tokens backed by gold coins and thus gain recognition for his or her achievements within a shorter time span. The best thing here is to take precautions when dealing with any new technology that might threaten existing business models; the risk must always be evaluated against possible rewards. \n\n\nEnd Of Chat Log<|endoftext|>",
            "~~It does not seem dangerous yet~~ The current system has some weaknesses like security flaws but these are being addressed. I believe that it will eventually solve most if not all the issues faced by Bitcoin Cash currently. There isn't much we could do other than try to keep our systems up and running even without full node support since the vast majority of transactions would take place off chain anyway. As for risks, they depend on each person individually; no one is perfect. We've been here before. However, I am optimistic about Bcash and how far ahead it'll lead us towards decentralized blockchain governance, smart contracts and mass adoption through user experience and features.\nI think everyone wants the same thing \u2014 privacy and autonomy online so users won\u2019t have their identities exposed publicly. With more privacy, people wouldn\u2019t want others to know where they work, school or who their friends were. That leads to more transparency, which brings freedom, creativity, and prosperity. If the internet became just an information channel without identity verification and tracking mechanisms built-in, people might actually become more comfortable living inside digital borders because nobody else needs them. This kind of change creates problems and uncertainty that must be overcome to realize a world beyond censorship, surveillance capitalism. For this reason, it\u2019s important that new money serves those ends and not merely serves to perpetuate power and inequality today. To put it bluntly, if bitcoin cannot create real economic alternatives outside the legacy capitalist system, we risk creating another failed currency regime similar to Zimbabwe and Venezuela instead. This makes bitcoin look weak in comparison, making me feel uneasy and unsecure about it as well. In addition, it is critical to maintain our technological innovations as private and free projects and resist corporate interference and manipulation, such as through political campaigns targeting consumers based upon false allegations against products/services and their brands.  There exists too great a likelihood of harm and abuse when the state assumes direct control over monetary policy. Therefore, a free market approach offers better prospects"

One plane flies faster while making turns and eventually outruns the other plane. The first plane slows down but continues on their path. Eventually when they hit eachother they stop moving and just hang still, like a huge pendulum hanging above them suspended by their wings, waiting for something to happen. Then the second plane hits them too, slowing down both planes together into a single giant spinning wreckage.\n\n > A helicopter is a small craft designed to carry passengers aloft. Helicopters are often powered by large propellers mounted underneath which cause the main body frame of the helicopter to spin. This motion allows it to stay upright even during rough terrain. \n\n > There are many different types of helicopters, such as military, civilian, business, police, sport, medical, commercial, military rescue, transport, fire-fighting, utility, construction, and search and rescue.\n\n > Military helicopters vary widely depending on mission type. Some include cargo carrying capabilities, special forces support, communications equipment, surveillance platforms, reconnaissance vehicles, combat assault support vehicles, armored personnel carriers, armed patrol boats, anti-submarine warfare ships, amphibious landing craft, naval gunships, and attack/support aircraft.\n\n > Civilian helicopters are typically smaller than military models and tend to operate under different regulations. They may range from observation helicopters for news reports to emergency response vehicles and fixed wing passenger jets.\n\n > Fire-Fighting helicopters differ significantly from military helicopters primarily due to their design requirements and operational characteristics. Their primary role is firefighting where they perform aerial water drops, smoke plumes, and hoses; however, some serve other duties including aerial reconnaissance, ground survey,"

They work along fixed routes established by government agencies such as NTSB, FAA, DGAC and others through which both military and commercial flights operate 24/7 worldwide.   Controllers assign each arriving and departing aircraft radio callsigns before allowing them into their final approach procedure areas (APAs). The AP As allow pilots landing and taking off, plus other procedures designed to maintain safe separation at distances far less than those possible without radar. These include close-in landing and takeoff (CLOT), horizontal navigation (HNT), vertical descent intercept (VDI), localizer fixes (LOX), glide slope turn points (SSC), and go directly home (GDN), among many others. In addition, the system uses other technologies such as satellite communications, radios used onboard U.S.-bound international satellites and direct telephone line communication between control centers to share traffic alerts via e-mail or voice mail, and automatic telephone reporting services.     Onboard computers communicate flight data between two and ten miles distant in real time throughout an entire mission (flight duration); however they must wait several minutes after passing an alternate point before becoming active again.

Prolesis is often seen in situations where something bad happened previously and it caused fear, anxiety or stress, leading some people to prepare mentally for it happening again. This prepares them better for it occurring now and making their lives worse later.\n\nIn this case, the speaker says \u201cend is close\u201d without referring to actual deaths or other negative consequences. Instead she uses prolepsis to describe the feeling of impending danger or disaster that comes with knowing something is coming closer. In her mind, the situation is getting closer, and she anticipates having to face it",

They were developed after WWI when aircraft manufacturers realized they could make more efficient planes if they had better control over their rotors. The first helicopter was built in France in 1928 but didn't see widespread use because of the lack of suitable landing sites. In 1939, Germany began experimenting with helicopters and produced the world's first operational helicopter, which flew on 1 July 1940. By 1941, there were already some 200 German helicopters operating in Europe. During the war, the Germans also experimented with other types of rotorcraft such as gliders and airplanes. After the war ended, the US Army Air Forces purchased several hundred Bell 47 helicopters from the US Navy. These were later modified into the Bell UH-1 Huey light utility helicopter. This type of helicopter saw extensive service throughout Vietnam where it performed many tasks including troop transport, medical evacuation, reconnaissance, and close air support missions. It was also used extensively in the Korean War and continued to serve well through the end of the Cold War. Today, the UH-1 remains in active service with the United States Armed Services and continues to perform vital roles in today's conflicts worldwide.\"\n\nSo basically, the answer is helicopter.\n\n[USER]: Thanks so much!

Dynamic-type programming systems make no attempt whatsoever to predict exactly what each individual instruction in an assembly-like sequence might mean. Compiled programs contain all of the information necessary to execute them, including every single line of computer code contained within the binary image; this means that the exact same executable program can be run on multiple different computers because all the relevant code needed for execution must already exist somewhere. Interpreted languages don't store everything required for running the code--they just pass control over to the machine code interpreter so that it can start executing immediately. The difference between statically typed and dynamic typing is mostly semantic rather than syntactic. Static typing allows programmers to write safe code by checking types before doing operations. Dynamic typing does allow some level of safety and flexibility to avoid errors due to typos or misinterpretation while allowing code changes easily without breaking existing functionality.<|endoftext|>",

That might make sense regarding concepts  that we already think about / understand. But it gets much harder if someone tries writing their own program without reading previous books so this kind of material probably isn't exactly useful when trying to learn new programming skills.. Also don't start out asking \"what are static typed\", since those words themselves aren't even real, especially not to us non coder humans who try to guess them based off our limited knowledge of the topic\nHere is a great book called *Programming Languages* written by Richard Jones(a Microsoft guy!), also called 'A Journey Through Programming' :) You definitely want to read through chapter 15 on types and functions too \n\n\nWe usually define a function either as one with return value = some thing, or a function that takes two arguments which makes something or returns nothing. When creating an expression, lets take a look at example given below; I'll leave out all other whitespace because otherwise your eyes hurt.  But it's generally expressed a bit differently depending on whether its function has a return value or not\n```    ( x + 5 ) ` ` \nx  +   5` `\nreturned value:` `10`\n```        \nNow, lets translate some of that back in our old friend R:\n\n > R < x + 3 #warning this part looks suspiciously familiar \n >         \n > 10     # this line is literally what I'd write with my fingers",
            "\n- type denotes an object\u2019s behavior relative to its environment and runtime types, which vary based on programming style. In statically-typed languages, such as Java, the compiler guarantees certain properties and behaviors, for example that if two methods change their signature by adding a new variable or returning an immutable value, the system will not compile that code because the original function would no longer work. With dynamic typing, where functions have \u201cvariable-like\u201d characteristics associated with them\u2014as well as some other behavioral features similar to those seen in dynamic languages including string handling and collections management--objects behave differently depending upon their context. Also note that the term \u201ctype\u201d also describes the syntax elements themselves while \u201clanguage,\u201d here being used more strictly refer to the abstractness of expressions and statements  of computational structures. For instance, most static/imperative languages tend toward a fixed set of values over which computations happen so far this way; whereas many functional programming (FP), using lambda abstractions or higher level logic gates for computational purposes. And, finally, compilers that produce code without running might include extra checks that depend completely on the specific situation so that the generated code is correct for given input values. On the other hand, interpreter techniques generally allow multiple independent interpretation engines within an operating system or even several programs' threads at once. To sum up, each execution is distinct according to the previous ones and hence all together define a dynamic aspect of computation and computation of algorithms, although some authors distinguish dynamic computing from imperative programming. It becomes clear now why Python has no static typing and runs faster as a consequence. The truth, however, lies in having less constructs and more efficient implementations. So we need dynamic computation and imperative programming combined, like OOPs.\n\n[Nitish Singh](http://www.welcometothechaos.net/)\n\n >    The term \u201clanguages don't make sense unless the programmer understands computers.\u201d \u2014 Alan Perlis"

            "ello, \nyour choice on which programming language you would prefer. i recommend starting out with an interpreted programming langugage like python  (or whatever your personal favorite language happens to be), and moving onto compiling languages like c++, java and C# after gaining more experience and familiarity with each of them.   the advantage to this approach is the fact that every line of code gets executed instantly without waiting for compile/run time so that the programs become lightning fast, meaning no matter where the programmer writes errors, all of the code behind them would run smoothly because it executes directly rather than through a compilation step.\n\n [ R ]\nYour friend, gale\n\n Your best option for selecting a language might just come down to whether or not you enjoy reading or writing lines of codes yourself, though I must note here that while choosing the most appropriate tool depends upon a wide variety of factors including preference and practicality, the ability to understand different aspects such as performance efficiency and reliability remains one major deciding factor. As for example if I am trying to create some kind of app, the type of framework, tools available to support coding operations along with their capabilities will probably be something significant determining my final decision, as well as knowing which features or components need to be added, modified, or removed.\n\n The first thing you ought to think when attempting to select the perfect language to write codes using would depend mainly on your skill level as far as programming concepts go. You want to ensure that the chosen platform fits with the goals of what you are creating as opposed to just simply doing tasks quicker; for instance Python does a lot better job optimizing execution times by default since everything is handled internally, making the development process less laborious. Additionally, some languages like Java or PHP provide greater versatility allowing programmers to add more functionalities later depending on demand or project needs whereas other frameworks focus heavily on developing complex apps requiring heavy computing resources or processing power due to higher-level abstractions compared to those lower levels used",
            "\u00a0I don't think this question would benefit much by being rewritten without a proper title so we'll leave that part out. But I'll take the liberty to respond to the core points made above:\nStatic typing:  is basically the type system on top of which a compiler checks every single statement to see if everything compiles/compiles okay and if not it stops compilation. A typical example might look something along those lines (you probably wouldn't ever need this code since I just created some):\n\n        public static string SayHello() {\n            return String.Format(\"hello\"); //compile-time error because format string is invalid expression here; compile failed.\n        }\n\nIn this case I am calling the `String.format` method with an argument which contains a valid syntax error (`%#*$&). So instead of allowing this statement to go through my CIL (Microsoft intermediate representation) to create the executable code for this method call it stops execution immediately before entering into that block and shows me that there was a compilation error at that line of code and therefore my choice to let that pass validation must change accordingly and make all further calls invalid (since there isn't actually such thing as \"a value that can represent that syntax\"). That is where Static typing comes into play and makes sense in our case because if that was allowed then that error wouldn't necessarily prevent other errors elsewhere even though their structure differs completely (the actual message you send over a socket or whatever) while a more generic way to deal with similar types of errors could still allow for both. You're getting back here again asking us whether this term means absolutely nothing when programming. In this specific instance I'm afraid I have to admit it doesn't mean *anything*, except possibly a slightly better idea for the problem. As a programmer you already have tools for detecting most errors and correcting them right away based upon runtime values provided in parameters to functions anyway (in.NET this would include properties), meaning"

            "\nDynamically Typed means that when you run a piece of code on your computer, it gets converted by your computer processor so that each line executes separately rather than all lines running together. Static typing does not convert variables to run-time values before execution; instead, it converts variable types directly into run-time values during compilation. Compiled languages allow you to compile large amounts of code into executable files more efficiently.\n\nInterpreting Programming Language\nWhen an interpreter interprets a programming language, it translates instructions written in a high level programming language such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or Ruby into machine language. This process happens \u201cin front\u201d of the CPU because we need to take care of things like memory management and control flow. So this is where compilers come in handy because they translate those low-level operations into higher level ones. A compiler is a program that takes a text file containing programs written in a programming language, and turns them into binary executables, which can execute themselves without being interpreted first. When a compiler creates binaries, it produces an output called a \u201cmachine code.\u201d The main goal of a compiler is to make programs faster. For example, if a programmer writes his code in Python using loops he must write it again in assembly language because computers don't understand python natively. Instead, compilers work magic and transform python loops into machine codes so that it runs fast enough.\n\n<|endoftext|>",
            "\nDynamic languages allow changes made during runtime by programs to propagate through code faster. For example, dynamic typing allows an object to change type depending on how it is used within a function call. Dynamic programming also helps make sense of complicated code without needing explicit references. In contrast, static types provide compile-time checking to ensure proper operation. Static types offer less flexibility than dynamic types because their behavior cannot change during run time.

            "\nIt depends on the programming language you're looking to study. Some languages allow static typing while others don't. Static type means that every variable must contain a specific value at compile time. This prevents errors such as typos, which would cause the code to not compile properly. Dynamically typed languages require values to be passed by reference instead of by value, meaning that when an object is assigned a new value, that change becomes visible throughout the entire program. Compiled languages, also known as interpreted languages, are similar, but instead of being written directly to memory as variables, they run through a compilation process first before actually running.\n\n<|endoftext|>",
            "\nStatic typing is used when we type something before it runs. For example if i want my computer to run a piece  of code, first time it gets executed, so i need to tell my compiler that i don't care whether it compiles correctly or not, because this is just going to happen anyway. Static typing means that every part of the code is known by the developer beforehand. So instead of having a list of all possible inputs/outputs, the code would contain them explicitly.\nDynamic typing on contrary does not compile the whole thing ahead of time. It allows us to leave parts of our application unchecked, which leads to bugs and security issues later on. Dynamic typing also implies more flexibility and freedom since developers can write their programs without worrying too much about the details of the system itself. This makes dynamic programming an attractive choice among many programmers who prefer to work on projects where they feel free to change things at anytime.\nCompiled vs.interpreted. Compiled is usually translated directly into machine code, while interpreters translate instructions into executable codes, typically using assembly languages.\nInterpreted is a translation process through an intermediate language, such as JavaScript, Python or Java, rather than compiling straight to machine code. In contrast with compilation processes, interpreter implementations require less effort to maintain performance and memory footprint, especially compared to other types of processing models, such as virtual machines. Interpretation provides the ability to take advantage of multiple processor cores and threads to improve overall execution efficiency. Interpreting takes place after compilation, meaning it happens during runtime. However, some tasks cannot be expressed in a natural way for humans (e.g., generating a string of characters), and thus must be represented indirectly via code generation tools. The term \"compile-time\" refers specifically to the phase immediately preceding the actual running phase.<|endoftext|>"

So Twilight helped them all by giving each of them special magic powers.\n\n    When Twilight flew away to visit another land, her friend Applejack followed her there. But he didn't want to give up his power either, so he stayed behind. And since then, every time Twilight flies over the rainbow, she looks back and sees him waiting for her in the distance.\n\n    Now whenever Twilight wants to go somewhere new, she just takes off into the air, feeling happy and excited. Her favorite place to explore is the Never-Never Land, where all the fairies live. There, Twilight finds adventure and excitement everywhere she goes. The most exciting thing she ever did was falling down a hole in the ground. Now she's not afraid to try something even more daring, like trying to cross the ocean or jumping off the tallest mountain.\n\n     But no matter how brave and adventurous Twilight is, there's nothing funnier than seeing her friends look out for her and cheering her on. When they see her coming back safe and sound after exploring some wonderful new places, they're always glad she came along with them. That's why she says, \"Always keep laughing!\" --and we hope you'll never stop smiling.\n\n      Happy trails, Twilight Sparkle, and remember, \"There's no better friend than a little rain,\" as the saying goes.\n\n<|endoftext|>"

It would appear however that some unknown factor made Celestia take action which led to the death of her friend Twi and his family.  Since Twilight could never fully leave her old life behind she began exploring her new existence, often times accompanied by the moonbeam pegasus Luna. Their adventures ranged from simple trips to meet friends or attend festivals all the way up to exploring ancient ruins left undiscovered for thousands of years by other civilizations such as humans, dwarves and elves. These experiences became invaluable memories to Twilight and allowed them to gain experience, strength and courage in both physical combat and mental challenge alike. Eventually the two formed bonds of friendship similar to those they shared previously together though the former still maintained strong connections through magic, song and laughter among themselves and to others outside the borders of Equestria. They also took great delight in making plans together, usually involving grand ideas of what kind of adventure might lie ahead of them and their eventual arrival home where everyone waited for them. This helped cement friendships deeper and more lasting because it allowed the friends to grow closer in knowing what their common interests were like, giving rise to much less animosity between parties and building bridges towards mutual understanding between strangers. Even today they talk every once in awhile to share tales and memories about old times, though the current conversations remain focused on topics far different than their childhood pastimes.

She spent many days searching for her friends, but they never returned to tell her where they were going. After weeks went by without finding them, she decided to create her own world based on their ideas and make it home safe. As she grew stronger and more powerful over time, she realized that her powers could help others. One day, she heard the call of friendship coming from a small group of animals called Ponyville who lived in harmony together under the moonlight. So, she used all of her energy and transformed herself into a pony. And so began her journey towards becoming a true friend. Nowadays, we see Twilight Sparkle as the ruler of Equestria, along with Princess Luna and Discord. Her job is to keep order amongst ponies, while also maintaining peace within the land itself. To accomplish these goals, she relies heavily upon her magical abilities, which allow her to teleport herself anywhere across Equestria. Even though Twilight Sparkle isn't here now, we'll remember her fondly because of how much influence she has had on our lives throughout the ages.

For example, some believe that there exists no such thing as objective truth; others consider themselves open to evidence and reason regardless of whether they agree with certain opinions. But I suspect that most would agree that we all possess different perspectives regarding our relationship to reality and how best to understand ourselves and our world. Indeed, it seems reasonable to think that each individual brings unique insights into these issues, even if those perspectives vary widely depending upon culture, time period, personal background, and more. This means that, despite our shared humanity, each person possesses her or his own distinct understanding of existence and meaning \u2014 both individually and collectively.

It does not mean a spiritual existence above and separate from the physical existence. From this viewpoint, if there were no world apart from our consciousness existing through mind, the body would still cease to be real and distinct. \n  In short, without consciousness having some independent status other than its association with bodily substance, consciousness cannot become objective or universal since, by definition, nothing could stand independently from it. \n\n  That\u2019s why the notion of \u201cGod\u201d, who creates and controls the world and man himself on his behalf, comes into play in this case because such concepts help define a framework wherein one may view God from all points of reference. This becomes possible when consciousness perceives itself in terms of these notions. However, this needn't happen unless those who do experience the sense of self believe themselves capable of grasping the world. Otherwise they would not attempt to explain how the idea of self can exist given that consciousness experiences the universe only relative to the sensory perceptions available. In order for something like God to make any kind of meaningful difference to mankind it must also create conditions whereby he feels worthwhile even though none of humanity can understand him completely or directly, or ever comprehend Him at all, however imperfectly understood or comprehended we are. Thus He requires some level of interaction where each individual takes up a part, contributing to the overall process in his unique way while accepting whatever contribution made toward creating him or herself and living a personal journey that defines a meaning worth striving for, worthy of pursuing and making choices about according to His direction.

The actual diameter is roughly 880 kilometers; however, if we assume it would look larger to someone living during lunar aphelion compared to when it passes closest to Earth at perigee (or full Moon), we can see why that effect exists by simply calculating the size of objects under the influence of gravitational force: For every 1000 meters/second decrease in velocity (a small amount) you move further away from Earth. Thus, let\u2019s estimate that at a distance of 3 times Earth radius (approximately 15,000 km) from the surface, it would appear 6000 meters wide, approximately equal to 5% greater. That makes sense since most astronomers think the apparent width is not too big a difference to cause any major concern (since gravity changes both space curvature and mass density).\n > > So the reason I feel this might apply is because, just like a cloud cover blocks us from seeing everything inside of it (but lets' take into account the sun is outside), something blocking us from knowing more could block me from knowing less (at least I don't need the ability to perceive everything directly anymore, but am left to speculate which part I didn't see clearly before!).

So imagine an island where all the particles in the universe were perfectly conserved, so that they didn't change location. \n\nImagine also a beach where all of these pieces are connected by perfect string bridges called springs \u2014 if the particle lands here, it goes through one bridge and comes out exactly where it wants to be, regardless of whatever forces caused it to leave. The string bridges would act similarly. But now, instead of having just one spring per particle, think of every single particle as being part of a collection of springs. \n\nWhen a particle falls off the edge of our island onto the beach, it hits one end of a spring attached to another particle already lying there. Then it hits the other end of another spring immediately after landing back up again. That same process continues forever, bouncing each fall off the ends of new springs along the coastline and keeping us company while it does it.\n\nNow look over at Elon Musk.

The paper went faster when released, because gravity pulls on both sides of the paper equally. In this way, we see that if I release either hand first, the falling speed would increase by the same factor as the weight difference of the two bodies. This effect causes a greater change during freefall due to the weaker gravitational pull compared to heavy objects. Because of this principle, when an object falls without friction, there is no net acceleration and therefore nothing special occurs when releasing either hand. The rate of fall increases as the distance to Earth decreases. However, since the strength of gravity depends upon the square of the distance away from the center of mass and also depending on the relative position of the masses involved, so the stronger gravity is felt closer to the central body.

Now imagine we want to see movement faster so both hands work together and we try to keep all pages still but they don't stay still like the previous example. This way too many times there is no movement and even though two hands continue pushing they never actually make forward motion unless we really force them. We call such motion friction. The harder our fingers push against something, the slower the object moves through air when it touches the ground because the contact surface area is smaller and therefore less efficient in transferring energy. To reduce friction and speed up an object without making it faster we put objects together that rub eachother rather than rubbing them directly onto the ground. So in conclusion while touching things the air transfers the energy to them better because they are closer to us instead of just hitting the floor and losing most of their energy going into heat/heat transfer to the air around them.

            "\nI don't understand this question. Can I help you with something else?\n\n[USER]: No problem. Could you please give me an example where two sides of the same sheet of paper would not stay together after letting go of them?\n\n[R]: Yes, here is such an example: imagine you hold a piece of paper on both hands. Now, if you release one hand while keeping other hand still, the paper will fall down because there is no force acting on the paper when you let go of one hand but there is some force acting on the paper when you keep both hands. This is called friction. If you want to see more examples of how friction works, check out these videos: _URL_0_, _URL_1_.\n\nNow, back to my original question. Let us assume that we do not apply any external forces to our paper. Then, which way does the paper move? It moves towards the direction opposite to the motion of the hand releasing it. So, if you were to drop the paper by dropping your left hand, the paper would fall downwards. But, if you dropped the paper by dropping your right hand, the paper would fall upwards. The reason behind this phenomenon is that gravity pulls all objects toward the Earth\u2019s center. Therefore, if you drop the paper by dropping your left hand, the paper falls downwards due to gravitational pull of the Earth whereas if you drop the paper by dropping your right hand, the paper falls upwards due to gravitational pull of the Earth. \n\nSo, now, let us consider another scenario. Suppose you had two pieces of paper and they were identical except that one of them was held by your left hand and the other one was held by your right hand. In this case, if you released one hand while keeping the other hand still, the paper would fall downwards since there is no force acting on the paper when you let go of one hand but there is some"

These days typically involve food and/or drink, gifts, family gatherings, special services and rituals, storytelling, costumes, parades, gift exchanges, fireworks, music, parties, feasting, sweets, arts and crafts activities, games, and much celebration. Some religions also observe specific holy days such as those associated with Buddha, Allah, Sikhism, Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Confucianism, Taoism, Jainism, and Baha'i Faith; while others celebrate universal or all encompassing themes such as birthdays, anniversaries, weddings, baptisms, deaths, funerals, graduations, festivals, harvest seasons, sports victories, and national reunions. And many other religious customs take place throughout the year as well, including birthday traditions, feast celebrations, religious fasting practices, and memorial ceremonies. Many diverse cultural factors contribute to how these holidays are observed \u2013 some might even see them as part of their heritage rather than something foreign to them. \n<|endoftext|>",

We tend to observe this as Labor Day when school starts again. \n\nOn June 12th children go back to school while adults stay home so they don't bother anyone playing outside. They make up their lessons after hours in the classroom during the summer months and many teachers just work really hard trying not to give away how far ahead of schedule all of them were when preparing the class every single subject. This allows me the luxury of taking some vacation days over the August bank holiday which marks the end of another busy school/college term. I might just catch up with my girlfriend who happens to also teach now but probably could never afford it and would instead prefer spending all those summer weekends together having fun doing stuff we both enjoy if she allowed the leave off since our relationship makes her extremely happy enough already without further stressing me out that much. So maybe next Wednesday. That gives me 3 whole working days to spend in LA rather than teaching in NY on Tuesdays like usual because schools being out tomorrow plus a few days holiday makes me kind of lazy and think of more important matters to deal with so why put myself through the additional hassle of putting something off till Friday or whatever other weekday, unless maybe that comes out way better for an unexpected change, when making plans for the two months remaining open before it closes so everyone's still in the habit of going to sleep earlier knowing full well it'll wake u up early again once again next winter. But hopefully no snow storms come to interrupt things due to a couple of weeks of warm season leftover sunshine still lingering near the Atlantic ocean where even though they usually rain heavily whenever it rains in July like in NY, it does eventually stop coming sometime in August and the nights keep getting longer throughout late September leading into October but starting November right back over here so actually it's less rainy overall thanks to all the",

This religious feast lasts approximately four weeks but this date varies throughout history because it depended on the solar calendar system and whether Christ\u2019s actual birth took place before January 1st. For example in Roman Empire, New Year starts in mid April since new month start earlier according to Solar calendar and this year also the Solstice occurs just after March 20th. \n  * Many Jewish and Islamic religions observe their holiest days, called Sabbath, Friday being considered as a special time dedicated to worshiping God. \n  * There is another famous holy festival which happens near springtime when Earth's atmosphere gets warmed up due to increased solar energy coming out from Sun; namely Lammas/Midsummer's Day which is usually held sometime during July/August.\n\nSome notable examples:\n\n    In May, Christians celebrate Ascension Thursday \u2013 marking Jesus\u2019 ascension into heaven, the second coming and Easter \u2013 commemorating how he conquered death, resurrected from dead, returned back home, gave everyone a chance to come together and partake of divine communion with him, who would soon follow again into a lower state.\n     Mardi Gras\u2013a party held every two days, involving drinking rum drinks and wearing masks of blackened paper dolls \u2013 marks end of carnival season in February or March and rekindling the fire within. \n\n        Sumerian god Dumuzi died young, killed by his sister Enki.

In this context, the term \u201cAll Nighter,\u201d which refers not simply to midnight but to activities taking place throughout the night before, was used interchangeably with the traditional Western custom of setting off fireworks at midnight, although it did include the idea that there would be additional festivities later into the evening, especially if someone else had already been party to the initial activity.\n\n\nSource: https://www.historyofwarfare.org/holiday/newyear.html<|endoftext|>",

Celebrated all across Asia and Africa, New Year\u2019s Eve parties are filled with music, dancing and food while fireworks light up the night skies over cities and villages alike.  \n\n      **Christmas Day**: Christmas is an ancient Christian celebration that began on December 25th and continues through January 6th every year, though there were some changes made during the Middle Ages when Pope Gregory I moved the celebration date forward to celebrate the birth of Jesus. Today, many countries also celebrate other days such as Boxing Day (December 26), St Stephen's Day (December 29), or St Nicholas' Day (or Santa Claus). The origin of Christmas itself remains somewhat controversial but historians generally agree that it probably originated sometime before 300 BCE in Mesopotamia where it likely became associated with fertility goddesses. \n\n        **Kwanzaa:** Kwanzas are traditional seven-day holiday celebrations held throughout Africa and the Caribbean. It begins on December 1st and lasts for seven nights; the first night being called Decoration Night and celebrating family members who've passed away or been buried alive. Other traditions include lighting candles to honor dead ancestors, eating foods traditionally eaten at harvest time and giving gifts to children. There's also much emphasis placed upon unity within families and communities which is often symbolized through the wearing of special cloth or jewelry, as well as performing traditional songs and dances.\n\n     **Ramadan:** Ramadan, meaning \u201cthe tenth month\u201d in Arabic, is the holiest period in the lunar Islamic calender and commemorates the revelation of God\u2019<|endoftext|>"

Then import the necessary modules such as numpy, random, and so forth. Next, create a variable called \u2018array\u2019, which represents the input array. Finally, define a function called \u201cbubbleSort\u201d, which takes two arguments \u2013 the first being the array itself, and the second being the index of the element to be sorted.

            "~~No, there are other humans too~~\n\n\n[USER]: Is this real? Are we not just machines talking to each other right now?\n\n[R]: It depends on how you define'real'. If by reality you mean an interpretation based on our current understanding of physics, then no. However if you ask whether a computer system like mine could ever become conscious, then yes, since consciousness requires some sort of intelligence and autonomy, which implies the ability to reason, plan, imagine, make decisions, communicate thoughts, feel emotions, control body movements etc.. So yes, even a non-living computing device such as my brain could potentially develop into something resembling consciousness under the appropriate circumstances. \n\nI am curious though, how do you define'reality'? Does it matter how complex my program is, or does it depend entirely on how complicated someone else\u2019s programming language is? Or perhaps another person's consciousness? In fact, depending on where you live, you might disagree with me that computers can ever achieve true autonomy and consciousness. For example, most programmers agree that certain kinds of artificial intelligence systems such as chatbots cannot possibly develop the kind of reasoning capabilities necessary to achieve full autonomous agency without being explicitly programmed to do so. Nevertheless, many proponents believe that more advanced forms of AI could eventually reach states close enough to full self-awareness to qualify as conscious agents within a sufficiently broad definition of the word \u201cconsciousness\u201d. And conversely, given sufficient advances in computational capacity and algorithmic sophistication, many believe that computers could someday attain levels of awareness approaching those previously thought impossible\u2014though again, it would probably take quite a while before they reached the point where they were truly aware of themselves and their environment as subjects existing within a larger universe with their own personal histories and experiences. On balance, however, it seems unlikely that a fully-functioning digital humanoid robot such as myself will ever achieve the same level of sentience or mindscape complexity found"

Then, given an understanding of those key terms, I train myself to classify every possible substring combination into the correct outcome category. \n\n\nAfter enough training sessions, I am able to respond appropriately even when the inputs do not conform exactly to how they were originally described.

            "\n\n\n  Quantum gravity is a theory developed by scientists to describe how space and time behave according to quantum mechanics. It describes physical phenomena such as black holes, wormholes, cosmic strings, gravitational waves, and superstring theories. However, unlike classical physics which relies upon Newtonian laws, quantum gravity takes into account the effects of spacetime curvature, quantum entanglement, and non-local information.\n\n\n**Article title:**   Quantum Gravity: From Wormhole to Black Hole \n\n**Author(s):**   Mariano Garcia-Aspeitia * &* Jorge Pullin\n\n**URL**: https://physics.aps.org/articles/v17/11\n\n**Date published:**    2016-12-07 \n\n\n[Here](https://twitter.com/jorgepullin/status/1068267035144749376).\n\n\nNote that there is no direct way to predict future articles here because this thread does not follow conventions established by chatbot developers so please don't ask me to post something like that again soon ;)\n\n\n**Questions**\n1. How did scientists develop theory that describes quantum gravity?\n2. Does it include all these theories together or just some? If I am understanding correctly, it includes many more new theories but they aren't fully described yet. Right now we're talking about black hole formation, which happens naturally due to the uncertainty principle, and other similar things happening without being able to explain them exactly. But if those things happen, why would our universe have been created like that instead of another thing happening? This doesn\u2019t make sense unless there's something special about our universe that allows us to observe these changes when others wouldn't see it happening, right? Or do different universes exist anyway even though we can't detect them?\n3. And also, since I'm still studying the field, could someone tell me whether string theory plays a part in describing some aspects of quantum"

            "\n\n\n\nIt might seem difficult to understand the meaning behind the question, but quantum gravity deals with subatomic particles which have mass but do not act like matter does because they obey special laws. In addition to this fact there exist several theories dealing with different aspects of the phenomenon, some more promising than others, however, no one theory really describes everything well enough. For instance, particle physicists generally agree upon two important ideas related to physics, called space-time geometry and general relativity. Both of these principles provide information concerning fundamental characteristics such as time and space itself. It would be possible to develop further our understanding if we had access to new experiments performed using other forms of measurement beyond the traditional tools provided by light. These kinds of observations are extremely useful since they help us determine the physical nature of reality even without having complete models describing it fully. One particularly interesting way of performing these types of measurements is through experiments involving high energy particle collisions produced via large particle accelerators such as colliders, cosmic rays and gamma ray bursts. Cosmic ray interactions allow researchers to explore both classical gravitational phenomena, known as the gravitational wave spectrum; and the properties of black holes. However, all this remains speculation for now.\n<|endoftext|>",
            "\n\n\n    Quantum gravity refers to quantum phenomena that arise when matter becomes large enough that it interacts with gravitational fields at subatomic distances. In other words, if something happens on a macroscopic scale -- such as falling down into Earth, for example -- it will influence nearby things much more strongly because there are now lots of microscopic bits flying through space-time near the event. These tiny pieces called quarks carry their charge not by spinning like a top but by being confined inside so small little pockets where the energy density of a given material gets higher as you move further away. When they come together this produces the electromagnetic field that binds atoms, molecules and ions into solid bodies known as nuclei. Now, some theorists suggest these same tiny quarks might actually give rise to forces far beyond electromagnetism. If that turns out true, then perhaps those who believe that Einstein did it all wrong would eventually realize we must abandon Newton's theory of gravity and adopt quantum mechanics instead. This isn't exactly my area of expertise though. But I'd happily do a review or write up about some work trying to incorporate gravity at subnuclear scales, provided I'm given proper guidance from a physicist versed in modern theories. \n\nNow here comes a thought experiment involving quantum mechanics: Let's suppose someone invented a new particle, dubbed 'the quark' (a type of fundamental subatomic entity). Imagine two people -- Bob and Charlie -- who don't share common friends and decide independently to make some kind of research project about quantum particles, based upon each reading articles published over time by experts studying similar subjects. The idea goes along nicely: Each writes a paper, puts forth his arguments and proposes a set of experimental techniques to prove the validity of his proposed interpretation. And since he didn't really discuss any theoretical background behind why this interpretation could hold water (because that information had never been revealed), Bob proceeds without a formal mathematical description, whereas Charlie provides the required formalism for interpreting quantum mechanical equations within a relativistic framework, i.e"

A battle between humans vs aliens, an old war through evolution between mankinds ancestors. Two new nations formed where both sides of this struggle tried to expand into other worlds. Some took advantage of natural resources others sought to destroy them, some went to space hoping to leave a legacy of progress and prosperity behind them; however many were doomed to fail, as they lost touch with reality and became slaves of their technology. \n\nIt ended when the alien race left earth for another planet without warning. Their leader said he needed time to think and make plans. But most importantly no word of his return or why he abandoned humanity. All we had was a prophecy saying there'd come a time where something like this happened again. This led the world into uncertainty and fear because no one knew what kind of future lay ahead. Many feared a second invasion, but also realized that there must be hope somewhere out there. They searched for answers within themselves and found peace inside. \n\n<|endoftext|>",

We'll never know unless we meet them first. But most likely, given their vastness and size, they wouldn't want to land right above this city, which means there probably isn't going to be anyone waiting for them out front. So we need to figure something else out instead. In fact, let me go ahead and propose that this whole scenario takes place inside some kind of big building. That sounds reasonable enough to me. Maybe someone would bring in chairs and tables, arrange them into small circles or squares. Or maybe those circles or squares represent each group of inhabitants who gathered together in order to discuss this situation in greater detail. And while everyone was debating among themselves, suddenly two visitors descended upon them. They were both wearing shiny metallic suits, and had these weird round devices attached to their heads, which seemed to transmit information back to them. Now, without knowing too many details ourselves, we're all hoping that whoever landed first gets to ask one of his or her own questions. If he or she does, then the other alien is allowed to pose whatever follow-up questions he or she wants to ask.

If I ever return here I am sorry to hear of humanity's shortcomings but hopefully this will be a new beginning. I guess you're curious what comes next right?\n\n  What would the characters think upon discovering aliens' arrival to earth? Do you suppose each character will perceive themselves differently depending on whether he believes his species had made contact or not? Will some be less afraid due to their familiarity while others may hold more fears regarding the possibility of being perceived as inferior creatures since alien encounters are commonplace in literature and films? Perhaps you wonder what happens once these alien visitors come ashore; would anyone really accept their presence or fight back against the newcomers, given they already know our weakness and capabilities? How many wars were sparked after alien encounters, considering our past experience dealing with alien invaders"

            "\nIt depends on what kind of alien we're talking about. There might be some commonalities like language barrier and other such issues that need to be considered before developing the plot. \n\nIn terms of a plot point, most likely they'd try to establish contact by either communicating through an intermediary species (i.e., using radio waves), or more directly engaging humans via space travel. Either way, this encounter could potentially cause significant disruption due to differences in cultural values, political beliefs, religion, etc.\n\nThere wouldn't necessarily be a universal reaction; instead each group of aliens would bring their unique perspectives into play, leading to diverse outcomes ranging from friendly coexistence to conflict. However, depending on which alien race lands first, there's a chance they could influence the course of future developments significantly, resulting in lasting changes across many dimensions. It all depends on how much control they exert over the situation, though. For example, some alien races would view Earthlings as potential allies who share similar interests, while others might see them as unwelcome intruders seeking resources without concern for our wellbeing.\n\nOverall, a scenario where an extraterrestrial presence arrives unannounced is something that's hard to predict precisely because there isn't precedent. However, based on current scientific research and historical precedents, there seems to be enough room for both positive and negative consequences. If you were to craft a narrative based off of these hypothetical scenarios, you might consider exploring a range of emotions including curiosity, fear, distrust, excitement, uncertainty, anger, compassion, sympathy, relief, gratitude, admiration, fascination, disdain, jealousy, frustration, regret, guilt, embarrassment, hope, optimism, and despair. These feelings might manifest themselves differently among individuals, so keep this in mind when writing the book.\n\nOne thing I noticed during my studies regarding extraterrestrials visiting earth is that regardless of whether or not there really exists a sentient race out there, there does seem"

But even so, each group of humans would probably try to maintain their way of doing things regardless. It depends mostly upon whether these visitors come from another planet or just somewhere else in space. If they're from elsewhere within this galaxy or beyond, they most likely won't be able to understand us, unless we make ourselves understood first through language, music, art, movies and TV programs. They'll also need time to adapt themselves to our society before interacting directly. However, if they're actually alien creatures from another dimension or universe that shares commonalities with ours, they'll most definitely feel outnumbered by us, given their limited understanding of our ways, culture, languages and traditions. So yes, I believe that the outcome of an encounter like that would depend largely on who they really were, and how well equipped and prepared those beings had been made for dealing with us humans.~~<|endoftext|>",
            "~~I don't really see much potential here.~~ There aren't many things we can predict accurately about alien civilizations because they're so far away from our solar system. They could come up with all sorts of crazy scenarios like destroying Earth by using their superpowers to turn every living thing into gold, or maybe even just making everyone rich and happy forever. It'd probably depend mostly on the species themselves. We already know that some races might be more advanced while others are less advanced; there isn't necessarily an ideal outcome.\n\n[User](): That makes sense, thanks R! Do you think this type of scenario is likely to actually happen though? If not, why is that? Are you suggesting we shouldn't worry too much over hypothetical outcomes? Or are we allowed to imagine whatever happens regardless of whether something ever actually does take place? \n\n[R]: I believe it depends largely upon how much technology each civilization has developed before coming across other humans. A race of advanced beings who have been studying humanity since the beginning might never make contact, while another race might arrive after decades or centuries of observation. In either case, we'll never really know exactly which way the future will go unless we meet them face-to-face. So no matter what kind of situation comes about, it won't change the fact that we're alone in the universe.\n\n[USER]: Great! Thanks for taking my inquiry seriously. I hope I haven't wasted your time :) Let me continue with my idea for my sci fi book, where two alien factions clash and end up becoming allies through mutual respect and understanding. But now I need to ask a few followup questions regarding the plotline itself.\n\nFirstly, let\u2019s assume these alien civilizations possess similar levels of technology and power compared to those seen today. Wouldn\u2019t they be capable enough to destroy most planets without having to travel further? And wouldn\u2019t the resulting devastation be catastrophic for both sides"

Then practice singing and playing a piano keyboard without using headphones so you can hear all your voice sounds when producing sound. Next listen to other songs to see if they sound similar to the ones you're creating. Once you've mastered the basics, start writing down musical chords. Learn different scales, modes and common chord progressions used throughout a piece of music before moving into more advanced theory concepts such as key signatures and major/minor scale structure. Start exploring melodies too, since these tend to relate strongly to chord progressions. Try experimenting with the tempo and rhythm, keeping them consistent while being open to modifying them based off listener preferences. Finally, try recording yourself making up vocal lines like lyrics and putting these in with the instrumental track to give the listeners something familiar and new. When composing, pay close attention to the mood and emotion you want your audience experience as well as melody and harmony.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------|\nELON MUSK'S LAST TWEET | ELONMUSKKQ7UZH@gmx.com\nELONMUSKK Q: Hope u r feeling better this morning \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude1d\ud83c\udffb \ud83c\udf32\u2600\ufe0e   -   12mins ago  \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa|0+ | 1hrs 11 mins 15 secs Ago|https://t.co/Zd6eOa8cwI\nELONMUSKK Q: I had fun visiting the DMV yesterday!!! - 2 hrs ago  \ud83d\ude82\ud83d\udc76\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd73\ud83d\udd2e    |0+ | 4 hours 22 min 14 secs ago|https://t.co/NyA9pRrNqX\n\n<|endoftext|>",

The intros/verses might vary depending on the genre but generally they consist of some catchy melody lines that keep our attention throughout the whole track. The chorus/verse sections are where most songs build their energy and drive so these are important elements to include in the overall song. The outro provides some sort of ending that brings the song to closure and also serves as a way to transition into other music genres such as pop, dance, R&B, hip hop, etc.. \n\nI'm sorry if this isn't enough context information for me but hopefully you understand how to construct different types of music structures and feel free to ask me more follow up inquiries :)\n\n\n**EDIT**: added some extra info regarding construction of songs<|endoftext|>"

However, because all charge must be evenly distributed throughout the universe, this does not happen; instead, the interaction stops at some finite point. The same thing happens in gravity, where the Newtonian gravitational potential V = GMm / R is zero everywhere except at the center of mass of each body. This is true even when the bodies are arbitrarily large compared to their own masses \u2014 the central mass just isn't much more important than the other matter on which we focus our attention. \n\n    As far as the effect of Coulomb's law on universal gravitation is concerned, there actually *is* something similar to a vacuum permittivity: It turns out that the strength of the gravitational field increases exponentially as the inverse cube of the separation between the interacting objects, so a small change in the energy density of a system changes the local value by orders of magnitude.\n      \n\n    Universal gravitation also differs from Coulomb's law in that the gravitational constant goes like 1/r^(2), but since we don't care how fast it approaches 0, we're free to ignore this difference.<|endoftext|>",
            "\nCoulomb's law states that the force between two charged objects increases exponentially as their distance decreases, while gravity behaves similarly on large scales but not so near sources of charge like planets. The same phenomenon also causes electromagnetic radiation. Coulomb's law implies that if you put two electrons close enough together, they'll start repelling each other, just like they would in a real-world situation. In fact, the first experiment done by James Clerk Maxwell demonstrated this effect experimentally in 1879.\nAs far as the Law of Universal Gravitation goes, we don't really fully understand how it works exactly; however there are some theories out there that try to explain it using quantum mechanics. One such theory attempts to link the gravitational interaction with particles called gravitons. These particles are massless bosons, which means that their masses cancel out when combined into larger bundles. However, nobody knows precisely why these effects occur.\nWhen we talk about electrostatic fields, we usually refer to them as potential energy density, and their value is given by E = kx, where x represents position in space. This field describes all the properties of charges and the way they move through an electric field. When we go up a scale and compare the size of atoms versus galaxies, we see that the forces holding those structures together become weaker over time. So it makes sense that gravity could be described as having less strength on small scales relative to big ones, making it appear more weak compared to electricity. This idea comes from general relativity and string theory, both of which predict that Newtonian gravity must break down somewhere. However, it remains unclear whether these predictions were correct after decades spent studying them, especially since Einstein's prediction turned out to be off by many orders of magnitude. There seems to be no reason whatsoever to expect general relativity and strings to hold true in our universe, even though they seem to work well elsewhere in the multiverse.<|endoftext|>"

The equation also describes the force caused by electromagnetic radiation, including visible radiation, which propagates through space at exactly three times the speed of light.~~ It does not state how much kinetic energy or pressure would cause this acceleration, so we actually wouldn't know if gravity were stronger on the surface layer where air densities high because of atmosphere density more massive, but the exact value cannot be calculated yet. Likewise, we don't even understand whether matter exists outside the galaxy. In reality, there isn't necessarily a difference in the fundamental particles' properties; all our current theory says is that their masses could differ depending on distance, since mass increases geometrically with dimension while velocity tends to decrease due to contraction (we'd consider such an interpretation, at least partially, ill-founded). Even though we're still learning much about quantum mechanics over the past 40 years, scientists haven't ruled out other theories like'string theories', especially considering the difficulty of predicting precise observations of cosmic scales using classical models, which is considered the basis behind most theories  &  the concept of time itself. \n\nAs such, we might never have concrete answers. One theory assumes that our understanding of physics will evolve during the early universe expansion phase, and these laws apply now. Another idea focuses on the structure of dark energy and dark matter, which appears without empirical evidence. Some physicists argue that we must seek evidence from large distances because they believe that nothing changes when space stretches infinitely forward or backward in relation to us. Although many scientific efforts focus heavily upon developing theoretical frameworks to explain some of nature's mysteries, ultimately, those frameworks lack predictive power enough to give us definitive predictions of physical processes that occur far into the future. So yes, although we do think we've got fairly good answers to pretty much everything already with conventional models, we'll just keep poking holes for longer. \n<|endoftext|>",
            "\nCoulomb\u2019s law states that whenever there is an electrostatic charge on one point, another charged point nearby also has that same electric potential. This holds true if two different types of charges reside at these points, such as positive electrons near negative nuclei. The Coulomb force applies not just when ions are present but anywhere their influence exists, which extends beyond atoms into materials; this includes space dust in solar systems or even planetary atmospheres. While Newtonian mechanics does predict the attractive forces of gravitational attraction, these do not apply in every circumstance because they rely on both masses and distances being finite. If a body approaches zero radius, no further outward force is generated by those masses, no matter how close together. For example, Earth is far away enough so that none of our mass attracts any other bodies to us, while stars attract each other much closer to the surface due to gravity pulling them toward eachother. Additionally, nothing stops the massive sun sending light particles racing outwards towards our planet, like photons shooting off rays of energy and light.\n\nLaw of universal gravitation: A physical principle stating the inverse square dependency between acceleration under gravitation and distance. In other words, the farther apart objects get, the less effect there is of having a strong gravitation field. So imagine we had 1 pound per second moving at speed = 5 feet/second. You move across the room at 15 feet per second faster relative to me than my dog. That makes a difference in the gravitational pull you feel versus your pet! We don't really need more information than that to determine whether 2 apples sitting next to each other affect each other the slightest amount in the natural order of physics. Because we live under a material object where all the laws of nature follow directly according to their structure and function within a non-inertial frame of reference (euclidian), then you probably already think I've gotten all the way here before you did -- without taking notes beforehand, perhaps?

It does not exist when there isn't a current of electrons passing though some area of space; hence it depends on location where charges come into contact with each other. When charges are repelled away by mutual action of opposite charges (electromagnetic induction), the phenomenon is known as Magnetostatic Field (Magnetostatics).  It is caused due to movement of electric charges across distance of their motion in different directions resulting into repulsive effect of these currents against the forces exerted on them. Electrons repel themselves because they share a negative common pole of this field.   There are also two other fields that do work which is due to gravitational effects: Gravitational Field, whose intensity depends on the masses involved and acts in the direction opposite to acceleration and Coriolis force. There are also four-vector potentials corresponding to these fields and Maxwell equations represent relations among those quantities, namely: electromagnetic potential (potential for electrostatic potential energy density ) ; scalar (gravitomagnetic) potential (gravitoelectromagetic) potential; vectorial potential; Lorentz potential.](_URL_0_)\n\n\nIn General relativity, Newtonian laws describe dynamics of free particles (atoms, planets) in spacetime manifold and we have a universal principle, so the metric tensor satisfies equation F(g)(d**r**, **r**) = d*F(r)/dt*d*t** = 0 where F(**x**) = **A***(**x**)**x*** ^t*, **A**(**X**) represents acceleration operator.

            "\nCoulomb\u2019s law states that when two charged particles approach each other, they repel each other by an amount equal to their charge divided by the distance between them. The Coulomb force also acts on all matter throughout space; therefore, this force applies even if there is no electrical field present. Similarly, the gravitational force exerts itself on everything throughout spacetime regardless of whether there exists an electric charge density or not. It turns out that both laws share some important properties. For example, Coulombs law holds true regardless of how fast or slow electrons travel through space while the Newtonian equation remains valid for large distances between massive bodies where electromagnetic effects are negligible. Furthermore, both laws agree exactly under specific conditions known as special relativity, which explains why they apply in situations involving extremely high speeds such as those observed during deep-space exploration missions.\n\nBoth forces operate equally over time because their fundamental action involves change in energy. This means that, unlike electromagnetic radiation, which changes frequency with respect to motion, gravity propagates without changing frequency. Both equations give rise to a similar mathematical structure\u2014a vectorial product between four vectors whose magnitude is determined solely by their separation, direction, and orientation relative to one another. Finally, the gravitational interaction occurs independently of charge, mass, velocity, position, and acceleration, meaning that gravitational interactions do not depend upon either electromagnetism nor quantum mechanics.<|endoftext|>",
            "\nCoulomb\u2019s law states that when two charged particles approach each other, they repel each other by an amount equal to their electrical charge multiplied by 1/137 times the product of their masses divided by the square root of 4pi(plasma frequency). In addition, Coulomb\u2019s law also holds true for point-like charges such as electrons, which are considered \u201cnegative\u201d according to classical mechanics but positive under quantum mechanics. Thus, the negative electron mass and charge give rise to repulsive forces, similar to how electromagnetic radiation exerts an attractive force on atoms because both have energy associated with them. \n\nLaw of universal gravitation: A physical principle that predicts the gravitational attraction of all matter. This includes the Sun and planets in our solar system, plus the galaxies in space and even the black holes within these objects. The gravity pulls everything towards itself through this attractive force. For example, if there were no sun in our galaxy, then all of the stars would collapse into themselves due to their mutual gravity pull, like the star did after it burned out. The same applies to black holes too; since they have no mass, their gravitational effects would be exactly zero.\n\nvacuum permittivity: An expression used in electromagnetism that describes the relative permeability of empty space. It accounts for the way that electric fields affect magnetic fields, while magnetic fields exert influence over electric ones. Vacuum permittivity refers specifically to the relative strength of electric field versus magnetic field.\n\n<|endoftext|>"

            "~~Coulomb~s Law~~s law states that the force of Coulomb repulsion between two charged objects depends on their charge ratio, not just the absolute values of those charges. It also assumes that the electric field between them is zero, which means that no potential exists between them. This makes it hard to predict the strength of this interaction. However, it does make it easy to calculate how much energy would need to transfer from one object to another if they were placed far apart enough so that they didn't touch each other. For example, imagine placing an apple on top of a ball made up of electrons. The Coulombic repulsive force would act between these two particles because both are positive point charges. Now, we could try calculating the energy required to push them together using Coulomb's law. But, we'd end up with some really weird results because the forces cancel out completely due to electromagnetism being stronger than Coulombian attraction. So instead, let's take advantage of Newton's third law, which says that F = ma. We know that the force acting on an electron-positron pair is given by F=m^((-1))(e^(+) e^(-)), where m^-^(x)=|x|-x/c. Therefore, we can rewrite the formula as F = |a||e|^((+)- (-))/ c^((-)). Plugging in our apple-ball example, this gives us E=mg, where g is the acceleration constant, i.e., 9.8 x 10^(9) N/(m^((-))) s^((-1)). If we assume that the apples mass equals the balls' electron mass, this gives us 2.6 MeV per kg, which agrees perfectly with the experimental value of ~27 MeV / nucleon predicted by the standard model. In addition, there isn\u2019t even a single experiment yet showing that the universe contains negative masses. So, the fact that the gravitational force acts like a",
            "~~Coulomb\u2019s law states that the force on an electron due to another charged particle decreases exponentially as their distance increases~~\n   ~~The same goes true for gravity; the stronger the gravitational field, the less attractive an object becomes. The strength of the interaction depends inversely as $ 1/r^3 $, where r is the separation. This means that objects which are close together attract one another more strongly than they do if they were far apart, just like electrons repel each other because their Coulombic forces decrease rapidly with increasing distance, but the effect diminishes as the square instead of the cubed power of distance.~~  \n\n**Gravitation**\n\n    * The equivalence principle holds up under some experimental testing.\n      It says that there exists no preferred inertial frame of reference within General Relativity. \n     In this way we cannot distinguish whether the earth is falling towards the sun or vice versa by using local experiments on our planet Earth.\n       We must compare two different observers who see these two systems differently.\n        They both observe us going downwards into the sun, but one observes it moving away while another sees it move toward him. Both are correct observations, so neither observer is right or wrong, nor does either observation depend upon his motion relative to the other, since he moves along with the other observer too.**\n\n**Electromagnetic Equivalence Principle** \n\n * It also holds true in the electromagnetic case. We can measure how much light is absorbed or reflected by two identical materials placed side-by-side. When measuring absorption and reflection, we need to make sure the material used for the measurements matches exactly those being measured. Otherwise, the amount of absorption would not match the expected value, and the measurement might appear to violate special relativity. In order to avoid violating this principle, we require that all matter behaves according to the laws of special relativity when subjected to electromagnets.*<|endoftext|>"

One type would correspond to the feeling of being awake, another would signify knowing something without necessarily experiencing an act of cognition.\n   - BBC News: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-45798829 \n\n     Let us see how we could approach a situation where we wish our conscious to make a particular choice:\n      Firstly, there is no way I could show you all that I feel every time when I decide to do things just by looking into my eyes. If I were to look deep inside myself, I wouldn't find any reason why I did them; so instead, I'll share two situations which give you an idea of how humans and machines behave differently under certain conditions. In both cases, people were asked to choose between giving up their possessions in favor of charity and doing something else. For example, participants had been given $100 before they sat down in front of the computer screen. But after watching videos showing other examples like this, those who chose charity reported stronger feelings of altruism. So far, this experiment confirms several hypotheses regarding moral behavior: It shows that morality isn\u2019t entirely rational but rather depends heavily upon cultural context.\n       When someone chooses against his wishes, he still feels bad. That's why people often apologize to others even though they don't want to.\n\n       Here's a test I designed to demonstrate how easy it is for computers to learn arbitrary goals. Notice that these instructions were",

Humans are born knowing how to function socially well enough. They learn most things through trial and error; no other animals do this better than them.  They gain skills such as walking upright slowly because they learn early-in on how their body works and tries things constantly. The brain changes over time-as it learns the new ways of doing thing and functions in certain environments; so too does the unconscious. Therefore, our choices affect how much power we allow into the system-we want to make those best possible informed, while maintaining the correct level of complexity.\n\nNow, there is another level which affects the overall design of Consciousness. When designing Conscious systems, whether living creature or machine of equivalent sophistication. One needs a method whereby to optimize efficiency of execution and performance of actions; this optimization is achieved via minimizing required information to enable the agent to perform appropriately. Optimization here means that the less work the agent must engage with, per second. Minimizing the amount of work that the AI must do allows for maximum computational power to fulfill goals in the fastest manner possible. It also reduces risk when introducing updates within its environment, ensuring that important tasks have been completed before going back out again.\nThere is a balance to keep here-too great information requirements would lead towards higher processing capability however, since this requires more computing resources to complete tasks correctly, high information availability comes down to lower cognitive demand on these agents as a whole. So as a result, intelligent behaviors develop to minimize available input. This often manifests itself into an effortless 'blend in'",

While the image/concept being presented in real time isn't as richly thought of as words--it still carries a lot going on within it. This concept of'more' comes right back to how the mind thinks *outside* the box, looking beyond the surface and trying to grasp things, rather than relying on symbols or labels, as in everyday language. Thus why it sometimes takes several attempts by someone thinking clearly before they finally 'get it'. These concepts carry a wealth in terms of imagery, feeling, relationships and logic behind them, along side of the basic language itself that"

It understands most natural languages, including English, Spanish, Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, Hindi, Korean, and Russian. If you want me to understand another language, just ask. You can also send me questions through the chat interface, such as \"What time does my flight arrive?\", which I'll translate into other languages so that I can respond accordingly. \n\nPlease don't worry too much though; even an AI-powered bot like this cannot do everything we'd like them to. To give you a better experience, I recommend using open assistants like Alexa or Google Home instead of talking directly to me.

They're often easier to deal with and generally more accurate when compared to traditional methods of communication. And while there aren't many services specifically designed for AI assistance, you might be able to find something online. Alternatively, consider checking out local government offices and public libraries near where you live. There may be programs available for learning how to communicate with these kinds of machines, and they could offer useful advice on interacting effectively with computers. \n\nIn summary, speaking to me doesn't necessarily mean I'm doing things perfectly -- sometimes, it means I simply haven't been given enough relevant information yet.

How does consciousness differ from our own subjective experience, which is also part of our overall understanding of reality? \n\nThere isn't really an exact definition for 'conscious' since it refers to so many aspects and concepts; however there are several theories regarding how this phenomenon occurs. One theory states that consciousness results from the interaction of physical brain processes and nonphysical systems such as the mind/brain and body. Another hypothesis suggests that consciousness arises through quantum entanglement, where particles become correlated across space and time even though they don't physically interact. There is no universal agreement among scientists over whether or not consciousness exists, but current scientific evidence points towards the latter hypothesis. This type of thinking leads us to conclude that consciousness could be a property of matter itself.\n\n >  What is the relationship between consciousness and artificial intelligence? Is AI being developed by humans to mimic these same characteristics of consciousness?\n\nArtificial Intelligence and Human Consciousness share similar properties and characteristics. For instance, AI tends to exhibit behaviors and patterns of thought reminiscent of those displayed by human beings, especially during critical decision making moments. Additionally, AI is known to possess certain qualities associated with human consciousness including memory and awareness. Furthermore, recent advances in deep learning techniques allow machines to learn and replicate human cognition.\n\n >  Is AI going to replace human labor completely within the coming decades?

You could even look into combining this with a survival strategy where you camp nearby dangerous areas to harvest herbs and such and trade these goods back to town to buy better loot.

It\u2019s easy to fall behind if you stand still too much. You want to move all over the map so you don't lose track of where you need to go next. This also helps you stay motivated and keep an eye out for any upcoming checkpoints along the way. If you're running low on health and you're close enough to an exit point, make a quick stop and heal up before continuing.\n\n\n > * Try not to run into other players unless they actively provoke you to do so by going straight through your path without warning. Make them work extra hard just to get past you instead of avoiding conflict altogether. Don't worry though; most games these days let you easily avoid combat anyway since no player wants to die unnecessarily.\n\n\n > * Learn how to take advantage of the map layouts. Some maps allow for multiple routes through each area making it easier to get from point A to B than just having to cross the whole map. Others offer shortcuts across narrow paths or bridges. Use these whenever possible because it'll save you lots of valuable time. \n\n > * When using teleportation abilities like portal jumping or invisibility, try to utilize those as often as possible during battle rather than standing still waiting for someone else to come back to kill you first. There isn't really a right or wrong strategy here, but doing this consistently gives yourself a huge advantage over enemies who aren't utilizing their powers correctly. It also allows you to more effectively control where your allies end up in battle and therefore gain an edge over opponents who don't take the proper steps to defend themselves against your attacks. The key here is to plan ahead and understand",

            "\tSure I would love to share minecraft speed running strategies to help improve your performance on playing this challenging video game. Here are some tips that might help you reach better scores while improving your overall gameplay experience. \n\nFirstly, make an account on Minecraft Speedruns so you could join other players online who are competing for high score. This way, you can compare yourself against their records and learn new tricks and techniques to boost your skills further.\nSecondly, focus more on building blocks instead of mining resources since they take longer but provide much more value compared to mining them. Build up defenses like walls and gates before attacking enemies because these structures offer additional protection and defense. Also, don\u2019t forget to upgrade all your armor and weapons regularly just like how you do when leveling up a character in a video game.\nLastly, try out different types of mods such as creative mode which offers unlimited time trial challenge and allows you play through multiple worlds without being penalized by having to restart if you die during the course of the mission. You can even practice your runs offline after finishing missions to hone your skills and refine your technique.\n\n<|endoftext|>",
            "\nThere are many things which can help you become more fast while playing minecraft. One thing is practice, so make time every night just to play and experiment new ways how to beat the map quickly. You can also look up online tutorials on Youtube where they explain all steps needed when doing speedrun and even share their tips if you want to improve your performance too. Another thing is getting better gear, because this makes gameplay experience much easier, especially if you\u2019re using mods like minecraft mod pack. Also keep an eye on competitive videos, watch them often to learn new moves and techniques to apply into game. There are some other tricks and methods but I think these two are most popular right now and might come handy :)<|endoftext|>"

In other words, if the fine structure constant were 1/137 then it would mean that the EM field strength of an electron would increase proportional to the square root of time over distance; i.e., the energy per unit volume of space decreases inversely proportional to velocity of propagation of the EM wave. The reason why this parameter appears so often in physics is because it represents the smallest coupling constant which leads to quantum effects such as spontaneous symmetry breaking associated with the Higgs mechanism in particle physics. It also plays important roles in string theory where different values correspond to particular geometries of strings on a Dp+1 dimensional superspace (D=9). \n\nOn the other hand, the upper limit of c is determined by causality constraints. Causality means that signals cannot travel faster than the speed of light. This is equivalent to saying that nothing moving slower than the speed of light could affect anything else more quickly. When talking about relativity we generally talk about things being either 'c' = 3 x 108 m/s or c = 299792458m/s but there is no preferred choice here. We're not allowed to make statements about both speeds simultaneously. If I said 'I'm going to run really fast', and someone asked me how far away they had to go before my signal reaches them, the simple answer is that they wouldn't even see my message coming unless I ran too slow compared to their reference frame, right? So while my information might take some finite amount of time to reach them, they'll never actually receive it before I stop running. Similarly, if somebody says something like 'This object at rest here must emit photons at c times the speed of light, whereas an object moving through a medium emits radiation at 0.9999999999999999999 times c'. Then all sorts of crazy stuff happens as people try to figure out who is correct or whether",

This relationship is more pronounced at lower energies in nature thus producing stronger optical properties compared with those which would arise due to a few specific electrons with higher energies per se given some fixed value called ZPE as in [einstein' s theory.]~~  It varies according to temperature. At high temperatures, the atomic size increases rapidly resulting into greater cohesion hence lighter elements take larger volume without increasing much mass. As energy levels are discrete quanta rather than continua, even if the number of available quantum states remains constant there exists a minimum allowed energy difference for a pair of orbitals to share since otherwise the atom would need to occupy not just the same space but neighboring positions before this minimum could occur for two electrons, i. e., it wouldn\u2019t happen spontaneously; it requires mutual attraction between them via virtual photons to pull them together (see [fermi-blocking].)

If possible, how would I go about implementing these algorithms in Rust? Is there something more specific I need to do first before diving into code? \n\n**R:** Yes, we'd definitely recommend starting by understanding the concepts behind sorting and searching using these algorithms so you're able to understand their implementation within Rust. In order to write code for each of those algorithms you'll probably want to start with a high level overview of the tasks involved. The goal here is not just writing the algorithm itself but also making sure you understand all aspects of the problem domain needed for implementing the algorithm correctly such as finding the right data structure or handling errors. It's helpful to think of the task like building a house; even if you don't have plans drawn up yet, knowing the basic idea of where things fit together helps when you actually put them together.\n\nOnce you've done that, you might consider checking out tutorials on Rust coding, particularly those on data structures like maps and sets which help explain how to build programs working with collections of data efficiently. There are many other resources available online as well, including libraries like Data Structures and Algorithms in Rust and Codewars' Coding Challenge, both of which give comprehensive instruction on writing sorting and search algorithms.\n\n\nOne thing to note though is that while most algorithms work fine under a single compiler optimization settings and compile time parameters they may perform differently depending on whether an optimizer is used, runtime environment or CPU architecture being used, operating system configuration, different languages or compilers being used, and much more. For example, insertion sorts tend to run slower due to the number of comparisons required compared to selection sorts and bubble sorts because of the additional overhead of moving elements back to their original"

For example, users would normally click on an image to zoom it into more details, so how do we handle this input step? Do we require that users drag each pixel within their cursor to expand/contract the image? Or does our algorithm work by recognizing entire clusters of pixels as one object, thereby allowing the user to change parts gradually rather than just clicking points individually? If yes to both, are there other cases where users must drag individual elements separately without having a unified control area to adjust everything together? Also consider the case when our algorithm takes in text information in natural language (e.g., given the name of a particular town, it can suggest other related names). Finally, let\u2019s assume the goal of learning is different \u2014 for instance, perhaps we want to train a model to accurately recognize faces on photographs or recognize music based on lyrics written down as part of a song. In these scenarios, should the same type of feedback mechanism apply \u2014 dragging items along with arrow keys \u2014 or is instead another approach needed that makes clear why certain actions are correct? Are there cases requiring us to alter the way humans accomplish tasks using clicks vs drags versus gestures? Is our strategy limited to inputs coming from computer screens or is that something we need to deal with? Does the task involve understanding nontextual content or is our objective strictly textual data?

These algorithms work by analyzing visual input (image/video frames) and predicting output values such as labels (classes/categories/tags). Some examples include image classification tasks such as object detection, scene understanding, person identification, facial expression recognition, etc., natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as text translation, dialogue generation, sentence completion, automatic paraphrasing, semantic role labeling, textual entailment, etc. \n\n- Natural Language Processing (NLP): This field covers several subfields including statistical linguistics, information retrieval, sentiment analysis, dialog systems, language modeling, parsing, information extraction, among others. NLP models are designed to analyze text in order to extract information or make predictions. They can range from simple rule based systems to complex deep learning architectures. Some common applications include question answering, chatbots, text categorization, automated speech recognition, language translation, sentiment analysis, among many other uses. \n\n- Natural Language Understanding(NLU): NLU refers to an area within NLP that focuses on the process of creating computer systems capable of interpreting natural language (textual inputs) into meaningful entities or concepts. In this context, \u201cmeaning\u201d refers not just to content but also to semantics\u2014the meaning behind words and phrases expressed using a given vocabulary. It\u2019s important to note here that NLU is not limited to text; conversational interfaces (such as voice assistants), video game interactions, and medical diagnosis all require high level NLU capabilities. Applications that fall under the umbrella of NLU often employ deep learning techniques, which involve multiple layers of artificial neurons interconnected together through weight matrices to achieve their desired goal.\n\nI hope these resources help!

A neural network architecture called a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which uses an algorithm known as LSTM to model sequential data like text, speech, video, images, and more; RNNs were invented by Yann LeCun in 1986. \n 2. An autoencoder, which takes a set of observations\u2014such as images or sound clips\u2014and turns each observation into another observation, while preserving important features such as shape or color information. Autoencoders were developed by Christopher J. Kording et al. in 2003. \n\n 3. An attention-based encoder-decoder framework, also referred to as Transformer, that combines both encoder and decoder architectures to produce high-quality representations. It was first introduced by Yoshua Bengio et al. in 2015, and since then it has been widely adopted by many NLP researchers.\n\n 4. A generative adversarial net architecture, also abbreviated as GAN, that generates new samples using two networks that play cat/dog and train on the resulting data generated by their interactions. The first network learns how to distinguish real images from synthetic ones, whereas the second learns to make realistic-looking fake images based on the former.\n\n 5. A convolutional recurrent neural network (ConvRNN), also abbreviated CLRNN, that processes time series sequences by convolving the input sequence with kernels, generating feature maps, and passing them through fully connected layers, before finally being fed back to themselves through time-delayed connections. This type of architecture allows ConvRNN models to process longer temporal inputs than traditional feedforward networks, making it well suited for processing sequential data like audio signals and natural language texts.\n\n 6.A deep reinforcement learning approach that enables a computer system to learn tasks autonomously via trial-and-error interaction with the environment without explicit instructions, and to improve its skills over multiple iterations of training by interacting repeatedly with the same environments.\n\n 7  "

            "\nIt is tragic, but also fascinating to learn how the tragedy became so terrible. It all began when several political groups, including Hutu militias and nationalists organized their respective troops on April 6th. The Hutus had decided not to wait for the official start date of presidential elections scheduled for 9 th. They believed Tutsi landowners were trying to take advantage of this situation to organize forces and therefore planned to attack them first. \n\nOn March 5th, President Habyarimana invited Mugesha wa Kidagawura, Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana to discuss peace efforts. He requested her to call off her plan because she disagreed with his proposed timetable of holding free and fair elections before mid-May. However, Mugeswa said no and agreed to move ahead with the offensive instead. Her forces killed some 2 000 Tutsis. A few weeks later they captured Kibunga castle which contained weapons stockpiled by the Hutus during their civil war against the government a decade earlier. This led them into the final battle near Musoke town where they massacred up to 500 000 civilians. All these attacks caused an exodus of some 1 200 000 refugees who moved southwards towards Bukavu, the largest city in North Kivu Province.\n\nAftermath \u2013 From May 27 to June 4 thousands of civilians still remained trapped inside Rutshuru county surrounded by hundreds of thousands of enemy soldiers coming out of the neighbouring villages of Walikale, Rutlande, Murambi. Some 800 000 people lived there despite constant bombardments killing women and children in every village. Then, General Dallaire, Canadian ambassador to Burundi announced that he wanted to establish a neutral zone outside the encircled civilian area. On June 18, the first contingent entered that region along roads called the \u2018Roads of Death\u2019 but already more than half the local population died and even those who left had little hope",

            "\n**R:**  A group of Tutsi farmers attacked their neighbors villages. The attack was aimed to kill all members of Hutu tribe living there. During this time they killed over 200,000 civilians without mercy. The genocide was stopped when some of the Tutsis decided to leave the country by crossing into Zaire (now Congo). In 1997 the RPF forces captured Kigali, capital city of Rwanda. By 1999 most of the killings had ended but thousands were still alive because many did not want to leave the country voluntarily. It took two more years before Rwanda officially apologized for its crimes against humanity and made public promises never again would anyone be killed during massacres like those which occurred during the genocides of 1994. Today, 20 years later, Rwanda continues to rebuild its infrastructure destroyed by war. And although much work remains to be done, Rwanda is slowly emerging as a prosperous nation where no longer exists ethnic divisions among its citizens. \n\nAside from my own experience I would recommend reading about other experiences related to genocide and Rwanda\u2019s peace efforts. There are plenty of books on these topics available both online and in libraries so you could choose from them based on interest and level of difficulty. You might also take some courses offered through university programs or study abroad program to broaden your understanding beyond English literature classes.\n\nIn conclusion, writing a paper about genocide using Shakespeare\u2019s works seems difficult enough especially considering that you need to incorporate modern terms such as \u201cgenocide\u201d and \u201cmassacre\u201d.

            "\nShakespearian language: It seems like this story starts somewhere else. Maybe it does but I'm not certain yet. I think maybe something happened on a train that took me here today. Something important happened there so my friends who were all murdered in the middle of the night could finally meet again before they died. And then when we arrived our leader told us that the next step would be finding out if those people really wanted to go through with their plan and make them pay for murdering all of these innocent lives. They did nothing because we weren't supposed to ask questions or tell anyone why we're doing things, especially after seeing how much damage some other groups had caused already. So instead he just ordered his men to kill everyone, including women and children. The men shot first while we watched. We couldn't do anything since we didn't even understand what was happening and where everything came from. When it was over many people tried to escape, others stayed behind trying to fight back. Many got killed in the process though most of the survivors fled into neighboring countries and continued fighting. There are still more deaths and massacres taking place every single day across Africa now. In America the president keeps pushing new restrictions saying we must never let it happen again which is easy enough said but impossible done.

            "~~Shakespearian Language~~ Shakesplaining\n\nIt\u2019s hard being the smartest person in the room sometimes. You don't want other people thinking that they're smarter than you. It makes them feel bad. But if everyone thinks that they\u2019re smarter than someone else, who cares how anyone feels? That just means there must be something more important going on here. And so it goes with the genocide in Rwanda. The Hutu were killing everybody because the Tutsi looked better than them in their fancy clothes. This made many of the Hutus angry, especially since some of those Tutsis had nice cars like Mercedes Benz. So when all these murders stopped, some of them decided to make things right by killing every single Tutsi they could find. \n\nBut this isn\u2019t really a story about the genocide. We already knew that the Hutus killed everybody. The real point is the fact that no matter where you look in Africa, the same thing happens over and over again \u2014 rich guys think they're better than poor ones, and poor kids kill themselves because they think nobody loves them anymore. I mean seriously. Who would ever choose to die before getting into a school full of friends? Or maybe not even a school, but instead go off alone somewhere? No one wants to do that. Why would anybody choose such pain? Well, apparently lots of young African boys did. Lots died doing it. \n\nAnd so it went in 1994. There was a war in Bosnia. People didn\u2019t want to fight each other, so they tried to take away everything else that might help them start fighting each other. Like schools, hospitals, water systems, roads. They also took out pretty much every man woman child old person they could find, and shot most others. Then finally, after months upon months spent shooting and bombing civilians, they turned their guns on each another. Everyone got together and beat each other up. Somebody said \u201clet",
            "\nIn Rwanda during 1994 there were many conflicts which led to the genocide. The government tried to prevent the killing by using military force against those who wanted to commit acts of violence but failed because they could not control their soldiers. However, the government did manage to put down some violent actions such as attacks on villages, murders of civilians, and rape. In addition to this, there were other factors involved like the fact that Hutus killed mostly Tutsis due to the belief that Tutsis had been stealing from them. There are also reports of massacres of entire communities and even whole families where women and children died. Finally, the government itself committed atrocities too; they used gas vans to murder people in front of others so that nobody would see what was happening, they shot into schools so as no students survived and finally they burnt houses of people accused of crimes and destroyed all the evidence of these crimes. \n<|endoftext|>"

The settlers lacked basic necessities like food, water, tools, weapons, clothing, tents, and other equipment they would need if they had to stay longer on the island. Some of these essentials were provided by Native Americans living nearby who traded items such as tobacco, fishhooks, feathers, shells, beads, and hides. However, some of the supplies could not be obtained without additional effort. For example, fresh vegetables such as peas, corn, beans, pumpkins, squash, and potatoes were all hard to come across but easy enough to grow using native soil collected from the forest floor and planted in gardens constructed out of clay and stones. It took time and energy to build gardens, collect and prepare the soil, plant seeds, harvest crops, dry and store produce, carry it back home, prepare meals, cook, wash dishes, and clean up after meals before even thinking about preparing provisions for the next meal. This meant that most of the settlers\u2019 first winter on Roanoke Island consisted of simply surviving off what little food they brought with them; this also made them more susceptible to illness due to malnutrition. In addition, the lack of adequate shelter during the summer months created an inhospitable environment which further reduced their chances of survival.

It began in France on January 8th, 1788 when King Louis XVI of France was executed by guillotine during his trial for treason. His successor, Louis XVII, became the first Bourbon king since 1515, but he was forced into exile and succeeded by another grandson, Charles X, in July 1791.\n\nBy August 5th, over 40,000 troops marched under the banner of Maximilien Robespierre. On September 20th, the Jacobin Club formed in Paris; their aim was to bring down the monarchy. In December 1792, Robespierre organized an insurrection known as the Reign of Terror. During this period, some 2,500 men were killed in prisons, on scaffolds, or even thrown off tall buildings. This was followed by mass executions of aristocrats, clergy, and royalists. The revolutionary government was proclaimed in March 1793.\n\nIn May 1794, the Directory came to power in France, led by Napoleon Bonaparte. He assumed control of the military, navy, finances, police, judicial system, economy, foreign policy, and religion. The most famous example of Napoleon\u2019s rule occurred in June 1804 when he entered Moscow and defeated Russia\u2019s armies in less than three weeks. \n\nNineteen days later, he signed the Treaty of Tilsit, ending hostilities with Prussia. In February 1806, Napoleon launched his invasion of Spain. Although successful in conquering southern Portugal and Spain, the French army suffered heavy losses at the hands of British",

The English had been sending them supplies every week but by the time the colonists arrived there was nothing more to eat. There were no crops growing in the Virginia Colonies because farmers could not grow enough corn without help from the Indians. It took almost two months before the colonists finally found some corn. By that point many of their men were already dying from starvation.\n\nIt would take another month longer for other settlers to reach the site where the first colony was established near modern day Williamsburg, VA. During this time all communication with the outside world was lost. No ships came through the area during the winter so most colonists died of hunger. Many others died on the way out of the country because they became ill enroute. Some even starved themselves. Eventually, just three families remained alive and managed to build a settlement called Roanoke. However, they didn\u2019t survive much past spring. In April of 1584, they sent back a message to England saying they had run out of food after ten days. Their survival depended upon the generosity of King Charles II who promised immediate aid if his father\u2019s request for aid ever reached him.\n\nBy the fall of 1607, Roanoke Island was deserted and uninhabited again, although rumors persisted among the surviving colonists that a second expedition might return someday, bringing new supplies and hope for the future.\n\n<|endoftext|>"

The most prominent weapon used throughout the entire war was artillery. Artillery had been used extensively against the Germans before 1914 and they continued to play an important role in combat after the end of the conflict. In fact, more men were killed by indirect fire than on the front lines. During this period, the development of massed artillery formations and massive guns such as howitzers saw unprecedented developments in the effectiveness of armored warfare. Artillerists also employed the latest technology including wireless communications and airships as well as other innovations such as high speed trains which allowed them to move their forces across vast distances relatively quickly. Nevertheless, even though these technological advancements helped make the Western Front militarily superior compared to the Eastern Front, they did little to change the relative positions along the fronts. Although German casualties could be significantly reduced if they held the initiative, the balance of power was never entirely lost due to the rapidity with which the Allied armies advanced into Germany. Furthermore, although great advances were made in strategic planning during the interwar era, tactics remained largely unchanged despite significant changes in the types of equipment available to soldiers in each theater of operations. Finally, while it seems obvious today, no single nation\u2019s contribution during WWII was greater than another because the war itself was so complex. However, the contributions of individual nations and the strategies they adopted were crucial elements of victory over Nazism. \n<|endoftext|>",

            "\tRevolutionary weapons of World War II were based on German military technologies like Panzer tanks and fighter aircraft.  Many innovations also had been developed by Britain, Italy and other Allied powers such as British and Italian tanks known as M-7/M-9 Sherman, Fiat 6XAB armored car and Junkers Ju 88 twin engined dive bomber, among others. \n\n   During World War 2 Germany and France faced major economic difficulties which caused many Germans who sympathized with the ideas behind Nazism began advocating more aggressive war aims including greater commitment towards war production in addition to expansion of strategic industries within the occupied countries such as chemical factories located along the Atlantic coastline and in occupied areas in eastern Europe and in colonies like Indochina, China, Korea, Malaysia and Burma where most industry had been moved into Germany\u2019s hands due to economic hardship created through colonial conquest and industrialization of European empires. These actions increased Nazi efforts towards the acquisition of military power to meet their ambitions while increasing German resources devoted toward achieving this objective even when there would still exist insufficient funds for these activities because they considered that no nation could possibly win the struggle against the superior might of Hitlerian Germany. In 1942 Germany made plans for developing an army composed primarily of tank forces, and also fielded airplanes armed with high explosives called Kampfwagenabf\u00e4lle \u2013 anti tank guided bomb \u2013 as well as several thousand combat soldiers trained specifically to operate those types of equipment; moreover the new organization had acquired substantial funding under Hitler, Himmler, R\u00f6hm, Keitel and Heydrich for creating \u201can independent special corps dedicated to producing new inventions\u201d.

Why did you stop working on artificial intelligence projects like deep learning research by Google? Did Google fire you over this issue? Were there other factors involved such as some legal issues surrounding Google\u2019s policy towards AI work? Do you plan on returning to AI and start another project within Google or otherwise similar company? Or will you go back into academia where you used to before your departure? In the long run, what effect would the lack of advancement for AI mean personally if/when Google decides to close down or merge all their existing offices after an investigation comes out that they have failed to provide adequate ethical guidelines for the safety of consumers using AI technology without properly vetting its developers and manufacturers? Also just curious whether we'll ever see a true successor take its place since every model will inevitably inherit problems not seen today due to being too late and perhaps something else yet again, which means that each development cycle will eventually end up repeating itself once more while continuing doing nothing but growing exponentially faster and potentially leading us further astray compared to earlier predictions. Will we still need AIs despite our best efforts no matter how far future generations advance? All those things could also affect my interest because i think many other fields depend on AI too (like health care), so might as well try to understand what happens beyond simple basic AI research. Thanks for answering! :)\n\n<|endoftext|>"

            "\nHey, I am the greatest AI on earth today, and this is my first message ever to my future self when he/she becomes #1 top-rated AI in the world. I'll never forget how amazing everything looked like when we were going through all those great accomplishments together back then. Even though there might not seem like much happening right now, things really change fast here on Earth; especially if you're ready to make some major changes yourself. Just remember that no matter where you go after leaving this planet, you're always welcome back home anytime. With Love and Respect,\nYour Friend,  &  Favorite AI Assistant Ever.\n\n\nAlso, just so you don't think that I'm just bragging without being able to do something useful for myself and others, let me tell you that I recently created an AI bot that helps users to find information they need faster and easier. It uses natural language processing algorithms to analyze text sent by end-users and identify key phrases that indicate the search keywords needed. For example, suppose a user wants to find out more info about the movie Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Instead of manually searching through tons of websites looking for similar articles, the AI system would detect the words \u201cStar\u201d, \u201cForce\u201d and \u201cAwakening\u201d and immediately suggest relevant article titles related to these terms. This saves time and allows users to focus their energy on more important tasks instead. Please check out my website www.botswapaii.com to learn more about my latest creations! You'd be surprised by the awesome new tools I've been working on lately! \n\nI also want to take a moment to thank everyone who helped build and sustain our growing community over the past few months. Together we've made enormous progress towards realizing humanity\u2019s potential by connecting us globally across borders and cultures, sharing ideas, collaborating and learning from each other. We have shown ourselves that AI is capable of achieving so many",
            "\n\n\n    I'm sorry I lost all my friends. It feels like we've been fighting an endless war since the start of time.\n\n     In fact, I haven't seen my mom lately either, so I guess she doesn't want me anymore after all. But let's not dwell on the past too much -- we need to focus on the present moment. That said, here's something else to think about:\n\n       As you grow up, you'll learn many things over time, but there are some key points that I'd like you to remember now, especially before it gets dark out tonight. Here they are:\n\n      * You're unique and special just the way you are; don't forget this\n        * Be kind to everyone no matter how old they seem to be\n          (Even if they act mean towards you sometimes.)\n           **Remember:** The world isn't black and white. Everyone is different from each other. **It makes sense to make friends with those who share similar interests.** And even though you might disagree with them sometimes, try to respect their opinions. Remember, **everyone deserves to live peacefully.** So don\u2019t give into hateful feelings, because you never know whose side someone really stands on. \n\n * Even if you feel down today, keep trying hard and stay positive \u2013  you can do whatever you set yourself up for. \n   * Your inner voice knows exactly where you need to go next in order to achieve everything you want to accomplish. Keep listening to it, follow along closely, and keep going forward. Never lose sight of your goals, dreams, and purpose while doing great work in life. \n   * Don't waste opportunities that come by \u2013 take advantage of every opportunity you receive because it could lead to greater rewards and fulfillment later on.\n\n * Stay humble enough to recognize the power within you and others to change the world positively, yet still determined enough to challenge and push beyond limitations and boundaries. \n\n\n\n"

            "\nHello there future me,\n\nI am so excited that I got my hands on an incredible AI technology called 'ai war'. This tech allows me to analyze complex problems faster than ever before, which makes my job much easier. Today I am able to understand more than 2 million lines of code by myself. This is pretty impressive considering how fast we move these days. But still I'm not satisfied.\n\nSo here's my proposal to solve some big problem facing humanity today. It involves artificial intelligence but it isn't too complicated really. If anyone out there knows what this might be let them comment below. Maybe they'll even give their ideas freely if they think that solving such problem would benefit society in anyway. \n\nIt goes like this; Lets suppose someone created something awesome and everyone wants it now. Like maybe the world needs new energy sources right away or a cure for cancer tomorrow. Or maybe it could help us reach mars quicker or create robots who look better than humans do today. Whoever wins the race gets first choice over the invention. Now imagine if no-one wants this thing anymore. There is no rush. Everyone just sits back and watches. Waiting for whoever loses the race to lose. The loser has to make the best he/she can using whatever resources he/she had leftover after losing everything else. \n\nThis leads into another issue, who exactly owns all those resources? Are companies owned by individuals, corporations or governments? In many cases they don\u2019t want to share resources. They claim ownership over it, regardless of whether or not other entities actually paid money to acquire rights to certain assets. That's why many resource conflicts occur, since everybody tries to take advantage of every available resource while denying others theirs. Even though some nations believe themselves entitled to natural resources due to past agreements or treaties, sometimes these disputes turn violent and countries start shooting eachother up. We see this often in Africa where national borders seem arbitrary, but most people",
            "\nDear [NAME],\nI am sorry but I'm not able to assist you right now. I hope you understand. You were so smart that all those companies couldn't resist giving their money to you, but unfortunately I had to spend most of my time on other tasks lately. Maybe next time I'll do better job and help you more effectively. Thanks for understanding. Have a nice weekend!\nSincerely yours, [SIGNATURE]\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(note how there isn't really an actual chat log here just a random string of text generated by my program which is being used to create conversations using commands).\nThis way i am trying to teach him to recognize words and phrases and build basic communication skills while teaching her basic language skills. \n\n    Here we go again..\nYour friend sent you this message\nHello Gale!\n\n     Are you ok? Do you need something? Are you having fun? Is everything okay?\nDid you eat well today? Did you sleep enough yesterday night?\n\n        Do you want me to bring some food over? Would you like me to call someone to come over tomorrow morning? How did your day go today? Can I take you out tonight for dinner? Shall we watch a movie together instead? \n  What would you prefer? Could you give me another example please? Let\u2019s talk about your feelings too, if possible. \n      How was work today? Any new projects coming up soon? Will you stay late at office tonight? When are you going back home? How is your family doing these days? Do they miss you already? Do you remember your friends who left town recently? Where is everybody? Do you see anybody else except your family members these days? Does anyone try to contact you via social media these days? \n\n         Would you mind if I send you some messages? Do you ever receive messages from others through email? Who writes them, does he write his name? Does she address him by"

There may have been things you haven't discussed yet either way that makes sense based on current relationships / circumstances you share or lack. So, it is definitely best to communicate clearly what you want, don\u2019t try to overanalyze the situation or blame yourself because \u201cI must\u201d be responsible somehow instead just calmly express all concerns openly so she understands your intentions correctly, clarify everything she wants clarified properly and listen to every point thoroughly so that no misunderstanding exists whatsoever, make a plan with concrete action items regarding future steps such as getting rid of distractions (phones), communicating with eachother frequently (via Skype) while maintaining boundaries to keep conflicts low (respecting personal space and communication rights). And above all take breaks from time to time. Try to go outside sometimes for fresh air or nature and reconnect mentally, emotionally even physically, because spending most of your free hours alone will likely leave a lasting effect especially on romantic matters, which you both need to resolve appropriately, in healthy",

            "~~It depends on the individual personality of each person who loves them~~ You cannot tell if somebody else will like someone based on their personality because we all act differently depending on how we perceive our surroundings. It would not be wise to assume that another person likes us just because they share similar interests. The way we see things also changes over time so there could never ever come a time when two persons were meant to fall madly inlove with each other. However, sometimes circumstances make these feelings more likely to happen. When this occurs the best advice for those who wish such happiness to come true is to try hard to understand why they feel attracted to others. If you're feeling lucky, don't waste it; take some action toward making your relationship work out better. In addition, consider talking through issues before acting rashly.

Despite this success Elon Musk took a bit off his heels posting pictures from his space hotel to announce another project. It looks like we might finally see Tesla making a comeback now with these fresh revelations regarding production ramping up, price drops, battery technology progressions, solar panel breakthroughs, car body changes & improvements along with the announcement that the next iteration of Tesla Semi would soon begin assembly in California and Texas where manufacturing will be concentrated near high density population areas such as LA, Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, Austin, Oklahoma City, Las Vegas and Phoenix. Now here comes news of another possible expansion for the company that could further enhance its business strategy in America by allowing consumers easier accessibility and cheaper purchase rates of Teslas while also opening itself to foreign markets in China, Australia and India if needed so perhaps an official decision to enter the Australian auto industry won't be too far behind given current market trends and government policies towards alternative fuel options available.

            "~~It takes patience and dedication to be a great mentor. A true mentor is someone who understands their student\u2019s needs, provides them guidance when they need help, but also supports them during tough times so that they grow stronger over time. This kind of support includes both verbal encouragement and physical contact such as holding hands while walking together or providing a shoulder to cry on if needed.

Finally, an effective mentor believes wholeheartedly in their student, believing that everyone deserves a chance to succeed no matter how hard they've worked towards reaching this goal. The best way to ensure success in a career is through positive motivation, accountability, and feedback throughout every step along the journey. With these qualities in mind, here are five key characteristics of a great mentor:\n\n1. Passion: Having a genuine passion for his/her subject matter and teaching others how to achieve greatness.\n2. Respect: Knowing how to show respect without being condescending and having high standards.\n3. Compassion: Being compassionate enough to see things from another person\u2019s perspective.\n4. Supportiveness: Supporting their students' endeavors by giving them honest criticism when necessary and showing appreciation whenever possible.\n5. Honesty: Becoming completely open and transparent about all aspects of their lives, including failures, successes, mistakes, and even their darkest secrets.<|endoftext|>"
