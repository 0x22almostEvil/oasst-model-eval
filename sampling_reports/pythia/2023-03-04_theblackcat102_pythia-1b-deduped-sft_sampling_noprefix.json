It allows for direct contribution (and other investment products like stock/bonds), automatic withdrawals at designated times during business hours (to save money for future use) etc..

However one must keep in mind the difference in focus: **while the two main components deal primarily with formal linguistic matters** they allow you to practice the underlying grammar principles within much wider scope since those will naturally arise throughout speech use and apply over a lifetime without further instruction needed beyond memorization and basic rules (though these should definitely remain the case): \n    1- **Learning the structure and semantics behind various parts of English allows learners who only learned via direct input from teachers/pros.** You wouldn\u2019t be taught a single concept by watching movies / television",

            "I don't know much about the difference, but I can say that a lot of them rely on different types of training. \n\nThe biggest difference is in how they use data to learn (i.e., how many examples do you need before your model starts making sense). If it's too small or too few then it may just be guessing at random things. A good example would be if you have an image of something with some text over it and someone says \"This thing looks like a dog\", and you give them 5 images from dogs and ask for their names as well. They will only get one correct answer because each word was used once so now all those words make up what they saw when they looked at the image - hence why you'll sometimes see people saying \"dog\" rather than \"dogs\". The same goes for other kinds of questions such as \"Is this a cat?\" which has no context whatsoever. It might take 10 times longer for someone to respond without knowing any information since there were multiple possible answers and the system didn\u2019t know enough to choose the best option yet!\n\nA second reason for using more complex language is that most models work better by breaking down larger chunks into smaller sub-tasks, e.g.:\n\n* Go find a toy in the house.\n* Put a piece of paper under the table.\n* Take out the pencil box.\n\n    * Look at the picture.\n    * Open the box to read the letter.\n    * Write the name of the object onto the paper.<|endoftext|>"

            "The Great Gatsby is a famous novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald, written between 1922 and 1925. The protagonist Jay Gatsby, played by Tom Buchanan, has just arrived from Europe to meet his wealthy parents at their home on Long Island. He tells them that he wants to buy some land for farming, but that they can only help him if they agree to give him time and money as well - one day every month or year will be paid back with interest (interest), another day's salary would still cover costs while he lived there, and so on. The main plot line of this story concerns the relationships between these characters: Jay gives gifts to Daisy who accepts them; Nick visits Gatsby and asks him to borrow $1 million dollars which Gatsby refuses because he does not have enough capital available; Nick finally takes action against Gatsby after having spent $6,000 cash and borrowed over $2,500; eventually Nick decides to return all the cash he had given Gatsby plus any extra earnings earned during the months Gatsby was living in debt; Jay learns that when he dies in three years' time, Nick will take possession of his estate free and clear.\n\nSo what exactly do I mean by \"metaphoric\"? In many ways it refers to imagery and symbolism used in order to convey something important about the nature of life. For example, I could say that most people spend very little time thinking deeply about things like history, geography, politics, or economics, except maybe once per decade in high school when they decide to start reading Shakespeare\u2019s plays again (though you should probably wait until junior/senior year). On the other hand, in literature we tend to think more critically about how human beings are treated than we might in everyday life. This includes metaphors used to explain various concepts such as \u201cthe way love works\u201d, \u201cwhat makes us tick\u201d etc., where a literal meaning is usually avoided as",
            "The Metaphorical Use Of Time By The Fool\nIn \"Gatsby\", Jay Gatsby is a rich and successful man who has lost all his money. He's trying to find it back, but he can't because there are always some people that want their money back or take advantage of him. As you read this sentence you know that time will be something bad for Mr Gatsby eventually (because he just got so much richer)  but at first we see him as very calm and happy. We also don\u2019t realize how fast everything around us changes until one day when suddenly everyone begins to change from good person into another person they despise. At this point I think everybody realizes what really happened with the situation: now nobody wants Gatsby anymore. This realization happens right away due to \u201cthe metaphor\u201d which refers to the idea of being forced by circumstance to do things against your better judgment/desires. In other words : If you have nothing else than yourself then no matter what happens you still need more money.<|endoftext|>"

The clock is a central part of these four \"big\" themes because they're all based around a set amount of minutes per day (that can be changed easily) or hours-of-day (more flexible), at which point each day has something it needs done for him/herself\u2014a work assignment, social meeting, etc.\u2014and then it gets reset as needed.

            "The theme of the novel is that time has stood still since ancient times. The protagonist, Jay Gatsby, must overcome this illusion and become a new person so he can live again after decades spent as one of his wealthy clients. A major aspect of its themes are social class, gender roles (such as wife/husband), sexual orientation (homosexuality), the value to society of wealth etc.,  and cultural attitudes toward money.   \nThroughout the course of history it was fashionable for rich people - especially fathers like Jay \u2014 to be eccentric while retaining their old-fashioned ways of life; meanwhile poor folk often adopted unconventional lifestyles or bought what they liked from other areas until by the 1920s they were back at square 1 on the scale of traditional values and norms. This period is referred to frequently within the novel when characters tell jokes in which we see examples of how modern upper-classness differs significantly from the way Americans had traditionally been accustomed to behave: some men dress and act \u2018properly\u2019 during business functions but fail altogether during parties and weddings because they have forgotten certain aspects of propriety. Some women even wear short skirts and tans instead of makeup\u00a0because there wasn't much fashion yet  & nbsp;, too little interest among middle-class whites for things such as high school girls going all the way through college dressed as boys with breasts and dresses resembling those worn by 1930's movie actresses.<|endoftext|>"

I believe that as you get better at being who you are (which means understanding yourself more) it's likely you'll discover some other interesting aspect about yourself. That's how metaphors work; they allow us to find our true selves even if we aren't conscious of doing so or able to recognize ourselves through language alone. \n\nYou've asked for ideas which I hope inspire:\n1) \"Invisible people can exist outside society because there is no 'normal' human interaction\" -- JG Ballard. He explores this idea further in his book *The Man Who Wasn't There* when he says \"When I am gone nobody really knows.\" But imagine everyone had access to unlimited power but no real accountability, all these things could go unnoticed...you wouldn't notice any differences until one day you die, would you? So think about this line. The world becomes completely alien after a point where everyone gets ridiculously powerful. How much different would life look from now compared with today if every single person knew their role inside society like Mr. Fitzsimmons does in \"A Clockwork Orange\"? You don't see any change right away though; the powers remain undiminished and each person lives in their own little bubble, never touching another person, while they have to live with constant reminders to stay in their lane just by living next door.\n2) \u201cFame was built around someone\u2019s name.\u201d This comes up a lot throughout history \u2014 the French Revolution used its symbolism quite successfully\u2014so here goes nothing, although maybe Fitzgerald thought the term \"the name thing,\" as you call it, didn't necessarily refer back to his father-in law dying shortly before the birth of son #4?

What does it have to do with us?\" said Mrs. Pritchard, who had been sitting quietly for some minutes. \"You'll find out when we get there.\" She got up abruptly, leaving her chair untouched. Then she came back into the room and stood beside the fire again. It was evident now what he meant \u2014 though perhaps not exactly why they should come here at all. As yet he knew nothing of the fact that people were beginning to go abroad after work, or that business was slow this week-end, so many new acquaintances must be made every day, even if none seemed likely to change his life much more than before. And while they sat round the fireside he saw their faces lighten gradually until only those few nearest him showed any sign of agitation or excitement, except himself. They talked of schoolboys, whom he did not think could ever really grow up; then they talked of books, which always bored them less because of their simple subject matter. But how often has a boy told such tales as these! How long would the book last under their spell!... Yet there were other matters which filled them with eager interest and excited hope.... For instance, there was another child who might never learn anything beyond arithmetic \u2014 just as Miss Sutcliffe's pupil would soon cease to read, without being able to remember where she left off...\"\n\nSo began F. Scott Fitzgerald's *Gatsby*, first published in 1925, following years of intense creative writing and editing, which included frequent rewriting, extensive revision (especially concerning themes), revisions within revisions, changes throughout successive drafts, etc., eventually resulting in a finished product, *which* may have appeared unremarkable compared",

His job as a salesman for Babbitty makes him aware of time travel; you have no idea how much time passed since you last saw someone, or even if they've seen your face before!

As one moves from north towards south (and west and east), there are more \"rings\" added on top of each other until you arrive at the final ring which represents eternity. In order for this to work properly, however, it has to have something that can be broken apart into smaller pieces called moments or events that occur within these rings, but not necessarily all together.\nThe idea of time passing by like a movie reel comes from the way film reels work: they start with a single frame and move through several frames per minute so that the whole thing will take place over a few minutes. This means that if we were going around our clock every second of our lives would look exactly the same because no change had occurred during those 2 minutes. \n\nHowever, when Fitzgerald's novel begins, time passes much faster than that - he describes things happening almost immediately after they happened :\n\n > It was just then I realized how very fast my life seemed passing \u2013 too swiftly indeed; and yet I knew that nothing could happen again unless I made haste. \n\n\n > There was only one person left alive whom I loved above anything else in the world, who cared less for what might come between us than any living creature did for his own existence. \n\nFitzgerald also uses the word 'now' quite often throughout the novel, although its exact meaning remains unclear. For example, while Jay may have been talking about time now, he wasn't really referring to the past tense (\"I'm still here\") anymore, since he died before he finished writing it down ; instead he used the present tense (\"He's back\").<|endoftext|>",

For example:\n\n >  He was thinking about what he should do next when she came into view again.

There was some evidence of contamination around 1986, which has led to various hypotheses regarding how it occurred (though we're not entirely sure why) - including one hypothesis that says it was an explosion on reactor 2 during an emergency shut-down of power supplies, with a secondary effect of creating radiation and other environmental issues from releasing radioactive materials into air above ground water systems near the area in an effort to control its spread through local communities (a practice referred to as \"disinfection\" for this purpose).\n\nIn fact, according to several news sources [in May 1991](_URL_0_), a Ukrainian researcher said they found something quite strange in a soil sample taken before and after the event: uranium ore containing small amounts of highly radioactive iodine 131. They believe it might be a remnant from an accident between 1946 and 1951, when radioactive particles were injected by workers onto two separate sets of cooling towers in the region. However, even though scientists had seen the amount drop significantly post-accident, there have been no conclusive reports yet showing what happened inside or outside reactors 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, 23 and 24. \n\nThat means nobody really knows where the contamination came from -- perhaps due to some combination of the aforementioned explosion happening on the reactor site itself or being transported to another part of the facility; most experts don't think it came directly out of any nearby source (or possibly contaminated the air further upstream), because so much radioactivity ended up just washing away anyway within hours once released overland. But regardless, given that no major incidents have since been reported, many are speculating it may never be properly understood--which I'll touch on later below.<|endoftext|>",

This is my understanding:\n\n1969 - The United States passed its first civil rights act (the Civil Rights Act of 1964) which was signed into law by President Lyndon B Johnson on August 28, 1968. It required that all Americans be guaranteed equal treatment under the laws they held as citizens of the United States regardless of race or color. \n\n1970-1972 - There would have been three major events after this date for African American people who had come out during the 1960s: the Montgomery Bus Boycott; the Sharpeville Massacre at Soweto, South Africa; and the Mississippi Freedom Summer Project. The former two involved a group called the Black Panther Party for Self Defense (a political organization formed in 1966). In 1970, the Panthers released tapes that showed police officers abusing black prisoners while forcing them to stand naked outside their cells.  This caused public outrage over the treatment of innocent men caught up in the violence. Then there was a massive hunger strike against the state of Illinois following riots that began in July 1971 due to the lack of food being provided by the governor. Over 200 students were killed when the National Guard opened fire on peaceful protesters demonstrating against the city\u2019s closing down of a department store. These actions led to increased national attention surrounding the issue of racism within the US government and society as a whole. The other event occurred in 1972 where the FBI arrested several members of the New Left Movement for attempting to disrupt an antiwar demonstration organized by Students for a Democratic Society. During these arrests, one member of the movement became known as \u201cBirmingham\u201d Birmingham Police Chief Bill Parker Jr., named after his father, also a policeman, later accused of committing some form of murder. Many activists from both left wing groups and radical groups would take part in what has become known as \"Bloody Sunday\" at 12th Street Baptist Church in Selma",
            "I'm not sure if this is exactly what you're looking for, but there was a lot of political activity during that time.\n\nThe US got involved with Vietnam and other conflicts around the world because they had to fight communism at home (though it's hard to say how serious that was).  At about the same time, many people started getting more concerned over global warming/climate change; there was some talk about starting \"carbon trading\", where countries would buy carbon credits from factories producing things like cement or paper instead of coal or oil - basically, trying to avoid having to burn fossil fuels as much.   A couple years later, Nixon resigned and Ford took office (and then became president) under an American-friendly Congress. \n\n[This](_URL_0_) talks about some of these issues leading up to 1968 elections, which included several national protests involving civil disobedience such as sit-ins at bus stations across America, etc.<|endoftext|>"

That document includes both what Apostle Peter said before his death that he was not sure if it would make more sense as an apostle and also whether Peter believed God gave him authority over other prophets like John the Baptist. There seems to have been two different debates about this: First one you mention from the New Life Church led up to Pentecost until early August 1967; after July 25th, 1967, people had their beliefs confirmed that Paul actually existed, according to Joseph Smith and others - when he says in 2 Thessalonians 1-3 \"For the Lord Jesus Christ came to give us eternal life\", they reject the idea that Jesus only died temporarily as part of the Transfiguration ceremony described later in Luke 23; in addition, the concept of being born again as described in Acts 4 (\"But we believe because He laid down His Life\"); these seem to contradict everything else in the Bible about how Christians will die eventually and still get resurrected during subsequent millennial cycles of the church building structure timeline (euphemism warning); here is another link [to an earlier section dealing with this](_URL_2_); specifically from around April 1968, this suggests the resurrection didn't even take place till late September or October instead of midsummer/beginning of December (again eulogizing Paul), though no specific dates appear - while this particular passage indicates the second coming did happen within time-cycles defined by certain preternatural physical events (which were usually connected to temple activities) such that, following revelations concerning the latter days etc., the actual first manifestation of fleshly reality occurred shortly thereafter, i.e",
            "While I will be biased towards the '70s, with a bit of help from history teachers for the late 60's and early 70's. \n\nThere are two very prominent figures in the world of politics who died or suffered some major setbacks during this time period. Robert F. Kennedy had come to power through scandalous acts such as trying to bribe Senator Paul Sarbanes over Watergate; he was assassinated just months before his presidential run ended up losing.\nIn other news (notably regarding Vietnam), he did try and end the war that Johnson/Sulzberger wanted but was blocked by Nixon..

Here are some other suggestions:\n\n- The Vietnam War began with Richard Nixon's decision to order troops into Cambodia on March 15th of that year and his withdrawal from Vietnam by August 2nd. \n\n- In June 1970, Uruguay was granted independence from Argentina.\n\n- On September 10th, the first major antiwar protest occurred at Kent State University when four students tried to enter campus armed with pistols; one student was shot dead and two others injured (including a student who died later). \n\n- After a month, protests broke out throughout California over what many considered excessive spending levels during budget negotiations between Governor Jerry Brown and state legislators.  Protests also spread through the rest of the country as well as several European countries such as Spain and Italy where demonstrators called themselves \"Red Guards.\"\n\nIn July 1971, there was an uprising against American involvement in Southeast Asia known as the Cambodian Crisis.

The Tet Offensive occurred during that time period, which is when many Americans began their protest for peace and equality with South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem after his regime collapsed following a coup by communist forces (and later American military intervention).\n\nThe protests started at the end of January, but quickly escalated as more people showed up to join the movement. There are several reasons why this event became significant enough to warrant such a big news story: \n - It was not only the first major public demonstration since the Vietnam Peace Talks ended, but it also marked the beginning of what's called the \"Tet generation\", where activists from different backgrounds would come together to form political parties or movements around the country. In addition, Tet represented one of the last major demonstrations before the U.S.-led invasion of Cambodia.\n - This massive protest took place on New Years Eve; Tet had just concluded its second day of celebrations, meaning hundreds of thousands of people attended the ceremonies throughout the night. Many saw it as a chance for those who wanted to participate in the revolution to do so.<|endoftext|>",

It's like some sort of \"what if,\" where things change drastically for other people who can go into different environments but still have the same basic knowledge about their environment that they were taught - including the process of combustion/explosion! \n\nHowever, we're not talking about explosions here; what you had was just enough force *combined* with time, which would allow for expansion through pressure, creating super hot air expanding through a vacuum system without even trying hard enough before bursting out through another surface...just perfect for turning liquid into gas due to capillary forces involved within our atmosphere. This concept can then be applied across many topics ranging from heat transfer and compression engines [to geology.](_URL_0_) With all due respect though, this method doesn't apply very well to fluid systems because there are no natural boundaries between fluids such as oceans etc.: instead it depends largely upon temperature difference, volume changes / convection (or whatever term you choose) being much more effective than any single factor. There should thus always come the need to look back to previous attempts at understanding something new -- otherwise we'd end up using entirely outdated concepts or having completely flawed ones. Which makes sense considering the current situation. The entire premise of a fluid explosion relies purely upon pressure distribution around two surfaces - this means those ideas will forever remain so until someone proves to us that these methods aren't sufficient when dealing with large scale processes like chemical reactions under pressures greater than atmospheric pressure.<|endoftext|>",

It might take 1.6x more performance from each of your graphics cards when working together (2Gbps). However if we look at other applications this wouldn't really matter since you don't actually need to perform calculations much anyway compared to a processor speed, and the cost should mostly stay about same no matter how many processors are used up there as long as each of them does their job just fine without too much lag. The extra speed provided by each graphic card alone could even lead to higher memory speeds due to the additional data transfers involved here though depending on which version/driver of whatever graphics card is running these kind of games you may notice the game load times becoming faster and thus you start seeing those high clocked versions appear during certain sections.\n\nThis goes into another reason why 2nd generation mobile chips aren't being introduced right now as there isn't really anything special that has changed over time, nor was anyone asking specifically about 2nd gen ones yet because obviously new stuff gets added all the time - things have already been optimized, tweaked, improved upon and updated for quite some time!\n\nAnyway if you still had to go back further than second hand parts to buy the correct GPU for whatever you're trying to do then it depends heavily on your needs, requirements etc..

More recently, optical surveillance has made greater advances allowing for both IR and visible spectroscopy/imaging, e.g., near-IR spectrometers capable of distinguishing individual atoms via vibrational signatures, providing images even down to molecular identification rates comparable to airborne instruments. Most new hardware upgrades over the past 30 years have allowed the ability to send video feeds back across any existing microwave link infrastructure already present in areas previously surveyed\u2014and up to three times faster than transmission speeds achieved originally, typically with a bit more latency.

The initial purpose of NRS was actually to gather information back home: imagery collected from one mission to another could help pinpoint locations of critical Soviet forces or even intelligence from agents who may have been sent to operate outside U.S. jurisdiction without proper clearance procedures allowed. However more common use within government followed after World War 2 and was carried on throughout the Cold War until decommissioning began in 1995 (the last official image taken up before disassembly would be in 1998).[3] This system wasn't entirely successful because many targets it spotted weren't used directly in warfighting roles--it was primarily useful for spotting targets near key industrial hubs like assembly plants providing weapon components such as jet engines or ordnance maintenance support systems around ships being repaired below deck, for example. It also became apparent as its service life wore down that there simply aren't enough commercial partners interested in using military assets produced for civilian purposes for them to continue to carry out these missions post-NRS anyway.[4][5] One notable success story was the US Coast Guard\u2019s Joint Surveillance Target Attack Range located offshore Florida (known informally as the \u201cKeyhole\u201d).

This program did more damage and required multiple reconfigurations later to correct for it while still continuing the project - another problem occurred in the fall of 1982 when there was an issue related to how long enough data would remain on a recon vehicle so they modified their orbits once again and made adjustments back into their planned flight paths to fix those issues before sending them down to test Earth stations as planned.

The United States Air Force was well aware that an accurate picture of those areas needed to accurately assess its potential response time if attacked before it could respond. This type of information gathering was important enough that there existed two distinct sets of technical requirements: one focused on imaging of targets using existing optical instruments, while another focused on detecting incoming missiles/aircraft over very specific ranges. \n\nThe keyhole system evolved through several different phases; during the 1940s the project underwent numerous revisions and upgrades, with various degrees of success, including multiple iterations of both primary mirror reflectors and secondary mirrors being added and changed over time until the final version had been successfully tested against both airborne and ground-based sensors. At first all tests used passive techniques, meaning that the only feedback given to the observer involved changes to how much light reflected off each reflective surface, however after repeated failures with early prototypes this approach began to fall apart when exposed to the atmosphere and required more complex adjustments made via electronic equipment installed within the observatory structure itself. By late 1944 many improvements were finally introduced to make them able to detect and identify moving objects - particularly large ones. \n\nAt the end of WWII, due largely to Soviet concerns regarding possible future technological breakthroughs and development costs associated with producing high quality, low weight payloads, NASA's prime focus shifted away from research programs toward building the spacecraft necessary to perform realtime data collection missions like those undertaken by the Keyhole program. These mission requirements included providing additional warning signals once an object detected was too close to launch vehicles for the orbiting radar telescopes which formed part of the overall Keyhole constellation.

The story of Adam and Eve, for example, was told as part of an oral tradition passed down through generations. It's not something you can just pick up at random; it has meaning because it tells us about how we should live our lives.\n\nIn order to understand what happens when someone reads the Bible, they need to know some basic concepts like \"what does this mean?\" or \"how do I interpret these words? What kind of world am I living in?\", which means understanding the language used in the text. This isn't easy if you're reading it out loud - there's no way to make sense of all those different meanings without having some background knowledge on the subject matter. So, instead of trying to figure everything out with your own brain alone, you use a computer program called a simulator (or simulator). A simulator takes one set of instructions and gives you another set of instructions based off of the first set but using new information. For instance, imagine you want to learn how to play chess. You start by learning the rules of the game: where each piece moves, what color its pieces will move to, etc. Then you get into practice playing against other players. Now, suppose you wanted to try to beat me! How would you go about doing so? Well, you'd probably take my advice and look around for ways to improve yourself. Maybe you could find more strategies to win games, maybe you could think harder about tactics, maybe you could study better strategy books, maybe you could work on improving your memory skills... But then you might also notice that sometimes things don't seem quite right. Sometimes you lose points, sometimes you draw too many white squares, sometimes you run out of time before you've played enough turns. And even though you were winning every single turn, you still lost. That's why you keep going back to the"

The bongo is not always an easy move, but in some positions it can be very powerful.\n\nThe most common position for Black with this opening would have to include 4...g6 and 5...f5. In that case there are three possible ways of ending the game: 1) Ruy Lopez 2) Checkmate 3) Rabi-Khonsu (1...BxN+2 NxRxe4 followed by Rd3 or Bd7). None of these options seem particularly strong since they involve checkmating your opponent's king - which he will try to do anyway. However, if we take into account how hard his pieces were to remove from the board at [the time](_URL_0_) then I believe even a better way out was to simply play 4...Qd8! and keep playing like that until his queen could no longer protect her own pawns. This sort of approach often leads to quick winces because it allows him to make use of other tricks such as taking advantage of weaknesses in both sides' lines.\n\n[Checkmate vs Kb5](_URL_1_) seems quite similar though less so than the original example above; both solutions basically force a draw while being much more difficult.<|endoftext|>"

The problem is that if you make a good start on bongo, then any player with decent material will win (as long as he's in an area dominated by bongo). This can happen quickly, especially against very slow attackers such as Geller or Kasparov who might not have much time between their pieces getting pushed out and your king coming back from hiding at last rank to move up. If I recall correctly this happens all too often against the strongest white blitzers, although there are other strategies like mambo and tiki bar available which can work better than Bongo depending how you choose to attack it.<|endoftext|>",

            "This is not correct. It's a very weak position because of it being open, but I don't think there are many openings that will beat this.\n\nIn terms of the rest of your question though - no. You have an awkward situation where you're forced into one of two bad choices (or neither), and can only hope for better options. There aren't any good positions here at all in which either player has enough time on the clock or strength left over to win decisively; so unless both players do something spectacularly wrong they'll probably just draw with some variation on their initial move(s).<|endoftext|>",
            "Not really. If you think about it, that's pretty much what happened when they played with the idea of the king moving:\n\n1) They started out in some position where the black pieces were relatively isolated from their neighbors (i.e., if they could only move one piece at any time, there was no need for them to checkmate anything), but eventually got to the point where both sides had so many unchecked threats and possibilities that by simply waiting for white to make mistakes, he'd be able to get an advantage over him (the reason why this is often referred to as \"the King-move\"). The game ends because then either side has lost the ability to hold back the threat or opportunity while the other side continues its forward movement, which ultimately leads into the eventual endgame of a drawn draw, i.e., losing your own queen/king on his kingside vs being unable to stop him gaining more material than he would have been allowed without checkingmate (in essence, playing too aggressively). \n\n2) As I said before, it seems like they are using a lot of positional ideas - especially ones related to pawn structure. It looks very similar to [Ruy Lopez](_URL_0_) (and I can't say how accurate this analysis will turn out to be). But basically, it plays quite differently from most modern openings due to two main reasons; first, Ruy doesn't require all white's bishops to go against their d4 squares (although in certain cases it might happen); secondly, instead of having 2+3=5, the player wants 3 + 1 = 4... This forces each player to focus solely on his bishop, meaning the players cannot just keep running around trying to capture pieces that don't want to be captured - since every attempt costs some points off your opponent's defense. So, even though they aren't completely alone, neither team has enough options open up until now that forcing a win is not possible anymore"

This means you need to be able to get into a position where there is only a single legal move available - in other words you can't afford to make mistakes or risk getting caught on the board.\n\nSo what I think happened was that after the first few exchanges were over, Black thought \"OK, we don't want to give up anymore\" and decided to take some risks instead.

The other type of split is known as *split 2*. In this case, it's usually better to use all available numbers because there isn't always enough space for your whole set at once, but when working with more complex problems like finding prime factors, having just one digit would be fine since you're not going through any fractions anymore anyway. \n\nFor example, let's say we want to find the prime factor 3*10^7 = >  3\\*2\\^4=1.5.

It might seem kind of silly if you've already decided to keep using every single number up until now, so I'll make another suggestion: don't bother dividing! Instead, break things down even further and create some new lists of primes based on what happens next:\n\n    list_of_primes[0] will have size 9. Each element represents the largest power of 5 needed after applying a given rule from left to right; these values will appear somewhere within the sequence `(2, 4, 6, 10).map{ x => 0..9 }` - remember that maps take integers as arguments? This map has no value whatsoever here. \n\n     list_of_primes[1].map { i | (i+6)/8} gives a nice table containing powers of eight that sum up to the highest common divisor of those primes (and also works well for the final result!).

Coldest place (I'll use temperature as a measure here) - In some cases you might consider something like [the lowest temperatures](_URL_0_) possible for a location; at other times there may be much higher than normal temps due to ice/snow cover. The actual conditions depend somewhat upon where and when one goes looking for those lower-than-normal temperatures, but they're typically well below freezing or above 90F(32C). It's probably best to avoid places with these kinds of extremes if possible, since people who live around them tend to experience colder weather elsewhere because they've adapted better over time.\n2. Average temperature  -- A more extreme example is how long a day can go without sunlight during winter months, so many people don't spend much time outside in winter even though they have plenty of sunshine throughout most of the year. Even areas with sunny skies get pretty chilly after about December 20th... which means it gets very dark before January 1st.\n3. Lowest nighttime temp -- If we look only at daytime lows, then all sorts of interesting things happen from February through June depending upon latitude and elevation.

(As usual, there are many good online sources available for these topics.)\n\nExercise-related habits take time, but in general it can be done easily by setting aside some space on your calendar each day or creating an activity that makes you feel motivated and successful as soon as possible. There will often be negative consequences of doing less work/exercise than planned, so start early and plan accordingly. Set specific goals with realistic expectations and reward yourself every step along the way if you accomplish them. \n\nOf course, this approach still has its limitations: If you're trying to lose weight or build muscle instead of just exercising, then it's more difficult - both because regular practice would have been too easy, making a change gradually seems more challenging, etc., while also having less positive external outcomes means being even harder on yourself). Other ideas include implementing techniques like progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) before attempting any particular task. This helps reduce stress levels due to fears and worries, and may lead to better results over longer periods of time, although again most long term success depends heavily on a person's individual abilities rather than technique alone.\n\n > Is anyone here trained for martial arts fighting competitively?

I've heard that there are some ways of making habits easier, but I haven't had any experience with them myself so I can only give you my own personal opinion.\n\nIf it's just going back and forth between one place (say your car) for work every day, then I think something like setting up a \"habit\" on paper might be good - create little reminders in your mind as soon as you get into each area. You could even use sticky notes or similar. But if it involves actually moving around frequently and/or spending time away from home where it won't easily happen, perhaps doing it via technology would help too. There have been studies done looking at whether certain kinds of apps made us more likely to stick to those things after we did them; [here](_URL_0_) was a study showing that when people were given the option they tended to prefer the app over manual activity once it started working for them.\n\nIn terms of specific habits: \n\n* If possible try to find activities which require minimal physical effort and don't take long. \n* Try to do what needs to be done right away rather than wait until later in the day.\n* Avoid multitasking unless absolutely necessary.

The first method would be to set yourself some specific goals or deadlines for how long you'd like your behavior to last (e.g., every weekday), then create small steps towards that goal by breaking up bigger tasks with smaller actions over time (i.e., do 1-2 things at each step of an 8 minute task). You could also make use of reward systems in order to reinforce your progress on those smaller steps. This isn't as effective when trying to change large habits such as smoking, but I'm sure many people have had success doing these kinds of activities through trial and error without using reward/reward mechanisms themselves.\n\nThe second method would just involve setting aside a certain amount of money per month toward rewards for good behavior.

This is harder since you need motivation to stay motivated with these habits, which isn't always there. For example, I've tried exercising once just out of sheer boredom after my work hours, then later got tired and didn't feel like working anymore - it was a very difficult decision to quit smoking cigarettes again!<|endoftext|>"

Cook has more recently discussed a number of historical theories as to who invented them in addition to other scientific hypotheses for their invention ([PDF], [Link 1] - Page 8).\n\n\nSo we're not exactly sure which method or how it came about; however it seems clear that there were some very important early steps (including some major changes to our understanding) between humans using beehives for foraging, beekeeping/pollen collection and human settlement at a large scale before these innovations started becoming commonplace through European colonialism starting around 1300-1600 AD with various techniques including burning of honey comb from trees being collected. There's no question whatsoever that those colonies are descended almost exclusively from native pollinators. However even without that you have one very simple thing called 'colonial technology' that would lead directly to many new things, especially after Columbus got interested and found a few islands off of Florida. That's basically just finding a colony of Native American workers and collecting foodstuffs they produced, soaking it up with bees, and letting people farm crops while waiting out periods until harvest. You could see a parallel process with all kinds of things like sugar making happening first because if someone else can collect a resource they then also know where it will grow and can plant what plants when and put in artificial fertilisers and water supplies and stuff too! It really does look similar but still involves us learning lots about the world we live in via history, and we'll learn far less on account of our reliance on technological development compared to other forms of colonization and slavery (I don't mean only North America, Africa, Australia, South America etc though, there's obviously huge variation in the rate at which such processes took place). \n\n[Dr. Cook writes]: \n\n > In any case, colonisation",
            "A long time ago, there was a tree called *Acacia senegal*. This plant grew all over Africa. A single seed produced enough of it to fill up one square mile of space on earth (or more than 10% in some areas). So, someone took this tiny plant and created what is today known as *Acacia*, which means \"one with seeds\". The next day someone found another similar species from Australia, then an Australian guy saw how big they were by growing them around each other until he made two giant squares of their skin together so that if you laid one flat you would be able to tell the difference between a person who ate a few nuts while standing up versus walking around like they are about to faint because your mouth will water just looking at these people...and after hearing him speak, they knew they could use the same idea again and build their own large buildings for storage, cooking/food processing, etc.. They didn't even know yet when it would get done or why; probably never thought about making things larger or having food storehouses before....<|endoftext|>"

The bee builds up these layers one cell at a time from its own food reserves until they are filled, which gives rise to the appearance of the pattern we now see.\n\nHoneycombs have also come in various shapes since antiquity; the earliest example I'm aware of being found in Egyptian tombs (which were built around 3000BCE), but later forms include square ones, round ones, triangular ones, pentagonal ones etc.. They all share certain features though: for example hexagons can only be constructed so many times before the honeycomb becomes unworkable or impossible.<|endoftext|>",

            "Firstly, this question can only really be answered through research into your individual situation and habits - there's probably little point in anyone else being able to give you more specific advice (if anything it'll mean they're more likely than you are to ask for something medical related).\n\nBut general health guidelines do actually say: \"do less\". This goes against how some other people like teas; if you generally avoid sugar then coffee will often work better as it allows fat absorption (the body absorbs fats from food by absorbing them as water) while also providing energy sources so that muscles aren't constantly running away with themselves during exercise (this makes them very sore when finished), helping digesting things (in case their stomachs get upset about having bits put up everywhere). \n\nSo in short, yes, caffeine would allow most human beings to continue enjoying life; it certainly hasn't been shown to reduce overall risk of death (and all the studies I've read suggest its possible that drinking at moderate levels does lead to certain negative effects, eg high caffeine causes people to become drowsy quickly because of the excess alertness which caffeine gives; whereas alcohol tends to calm you rather than make you sleepier... even though some drinks contain ethanol too, many people who enjoy strong alcoholic beverages prefer beers rather than cocktails since these tend to provide stronger effect.) But remember this is purely based on the premise here - 'low dose' amounts could potentially still cause problems due to overstimulation. Caffeine definitely won't make anyone fall asleep either- that whole thing isn't going to happen until caffeine has made most of our neurons stop working properly and suddenly.<|endoftext|>"

It's hard to get consumers excited if they don't understand why people care about the product they buy, so educate yourself on these issues before asking questions like \u201cWhy isn't there any animal welfare concerns?\u201d  If someone doesn't believe animals are treated well at slaughterhouses (or thinks otherwise), try to convince them using logic instead of emotion - explain the moral dilemma from different angles: If no one wants to eat beef, then they shouldn't be allowed to own it because of cruelty and pain; But if everyone loves beef, then why wouldn't you want to support a company doing research into alternative ways of producing beef? <|endoftext|>",
            "There's two issues here:\n1) How much you want your product for profit; and 2) How far down the supply chain (e.g., who buys from whom). \n\nFirst question:  how profitable is \"ethics\" anyway? The market price is set by consumers/customers themselves, not the supplier, so they don't care how ethical something was produced if it's more expensive because they're making money on selling it at a loss. In fact, people may actually be willing to pay extra just to make sure their meat has been properly sourced -- e.g., paying $3 per pound more if someone else doesn't provide it with quality control measures. If anything, this should only help lower prices.\n\nThe second issue concerns distribution: if you take 100% of your profits, then all customers will eventually buy it. So unless there are major problems before everyone does, most buyers won't know until too late that the ethics were questioned. Even then, there would probably still be significant risk involved due to lack of knowledge of the problem. And even when no one knows yet, what happens if those buying decisions are influenced by outside factors like competition between suppliers, weather conditions, etc.? It'd definitely increase costs and could possibly cause serious problems if companies decide to switch sources after having raised suspicions over them previously.\n\nSo these two points come into play together pretty well, but really it comes down to economics and risk management.

The most important aspect is learning how to say 'no' - if you want an expensive hotel room or whatever, just tell them \"Nie\", for example; if they ask why do we need to go somewhere and where's your car? You will get a very clear answer because you won't be able to understand their question without context, which is what you're used to when asking questions like these:\n- What kind of food would you like/can I order from here today at 7 pm?\n- Where does he live now?\nIf you've never asked those type of question before, then start by saying something simple like \"Do you want anything?\" instead of going with more complex sentences such as *Are there any restaurants nearby* etc.; try using short phrases so that people aren't thinking too deeply into the subject while talking over each other, rather than making complicated statements that make no sense unless you already know what you mean.\nSecondly, keep trying! If someone asks you to buy tickets, say \"V\u00e1rom\" (\"Let me\") even though you haven't been told yet. It doesn't matter whether they think you are joking or not, you must follow through regardless; once you've said it three times, they'll realise you meant it literally, and you can continue with normal English conversation. Try saying it out loud every time you see somebody else doing it, especially if they seem confused, and watch how they respond. Also use different words depending on who is speaking; for instance, \"No thank\".<|endoftext|>",

            "The goal with ads (in conjunction with others) in newspapers and other forms are reaching people at their time zone. People that read those types of articles don't watch TV everyday and if they saw a ad from one brand it may not affect them because the advertisers know how popular brands like Coca Cola/Pepsi make these products and use this popularity against consumers who shop online and read newspaper ads daily. Advertising can be done electronically by using computer monitors, but also through television commercials played behind schedule and on set equipment while actors take part in some action scenes which could be very dangerous. But being aware of consumer reactions would determine whether an individual sees the company's marketing campaign negatively because there was no interaction involved whatsoever nor were they even interested in what happened during each moment of the ad - just watching people react - making the idea unadvisable for companies trying to market such goods or services across age group so much easier than ever before\nThere has been work done into understanding the psychology behind purchasing behavior among younger shoppers vs older ones. Understanding that \"they're teenagers\" makes it easy for youngsters' buying choices since those children do not see themselves reflected back upon when choosing adult brands either. I believe there exists data indicating that younger customers spend more money after purchasing items then their elders who did not buy anything. The concept doesn\u2019t change unless consumers become informed enough to question both assumptions about advertisements and purchase decisions: How often have you heard someone ask why we don't think that way?

            "Creating advertisements has become very difficult because of how fragmented the world is right now, and what needs to be done with them once they're finished (such as promoting brands). This makes it extremely challenging for businesses in this sector, but also one that requires considerable effort. One thing that helps advertise effectively across different mediums such as print, digital, social, television etcetera can greatly reduce the time required from beginning until reaching final end by allowing marketers to take advantage of every aspect of their message \u2013 whether written or verbal \u2013 which increases engagement among viewers, customers and other audiences who may not otherwise have considered taking part. For example, some ads could involve asking readers about products like health food items; others would talk more broadly about why certain kinds of beverages are desirable to people, especially young adult males ; yet others might feature local restaurants and shops that cater specifically towards consumers ages 30-35. \n\nSo far we\u2019ve seen ad campaigns ranging from straightforward information to sophisticated content targeted at specific demographic groups: young adult male versus middle age females; low calorie beverage versus healthy weight diet option; local bar/restaurant versus chain fast casual options. Now let's see if our brainstorming process got us closer than expected: How does all of this fit into a bigger picture? We'll use Google Trends to examine how users are accessing particular words through various media over a given period. When using the phrase \"advertising,\" users search Google using phrases such as \u201cAdvertisers,\u201d \u201cPromoted Media,\u201d or even simply just looking up a term in Google itself without going too much deeper than this simple word. By focusing our efforts around keywords associated with advertising\u2014rather than ones unrelated to consumer awareness of an advertised item \u2014we were able to focus most attention away from general trends in online search results, giving advertisers access to better targeting strategies based off of data points found during actual keyword searches themselves. <|endoftext|>",

            "This is a great question! There are several ways to approach it, but here\u2019s what I can tell you from my research:\n\u2022 The best way to start is by defining who you want to be targeted with your ad. For example, if your brand wants to sell products specifically made only for people in their 30s (and therefore they don't have access to other brands), then make this part more specific. It could include age groups that might be interested in purchasing such a product - say 20-25s; however, not everyone has reached those ages yet so use different messaging strategies like using images and videos to show them how cool it is while highlighting features like \"energy drinks aren't just for old folks\".\n\u2022 Next up would be finding the right channel(s) through which your ads should get seen, either online or offline. This means deciding where to place each ad based upon its content. If you're looking for information regarding health topics, look at lifestyle websites, social media pages or even television programs aimed towards younger viewers. These types of campaigns often rely less heavily on text and tend to focus more around visual elements, making it much easier to understand.\n\u2022 Finally, when selecting the message/ad copy, think about the overall tone of voice and wording used throughout. A simple phrase like 'new energy drink' may sound catchy, whereas something more complicated such as 'the next big thing'? Try experimenting with various combinations before choosing one. Keep track of your performance metrics over time too, because there's no better gauge than results.<|endoftext|>"

            "I'm not sure I can provide the answer for an ELI5, but I just finished grad school in Information technology and worked on a project called [Open Assistant](_URL_0_) which was basically a graphical user interface to access information. The main idea of this program is that you interact with it by saying things into your microphone and using a touchscreen device or other input devices where possible; you see what information the application brings up based off of text-input responses from the system, etc. You'll find more info about OSA here: _URL_1_, so go ahead and check those out as well if you're interested!\n\nHopefully someone else can help though.<|endoftext|>",
            "[In its simplest, most basic definition](_URL_0_) is that it's an interface to a set of \"software\" which makes sense as the language and standard format used for interacting with those software. And by \"interface\", I mean a computer environment where users interact within this context (a program) rather than using some external programming/data tool - although sometimes these do make use of interfaces other than text editing or mouse clicks in applications like Adobe Photoshop.)\n\nOpen Assistant uses something called XML (for XML). This isn't a fancy word and we're not going to get into definitions here; that would take too long anyway! It doesn't matter if you think Open Assistant works great - at least from my view point since my knowledge base around things has grown substantially over time. Instead what matters is just how easily developers can start using this stuff in their applications because:\n\n* The underlying XML file (or whatever that data comes out of) will simply be available *anywhere*. You don't need special installation and configuration files on your machine but just having all your data stored on one place means less effort required when downloading and processing them. \n* The syntax might vary depending on exactly what type(s) are being used so there won't always have been certain parts before version X. So even though many languages support XML there might also be quirks due to technical limitations regarding reading from specific sources such as USB drives etc., that never got fixed until a while after first release.<|endoftext|>"

The system works by letting other agents see what the customer wants done first without asking them personally because they aren't part of this same VR experience itself yet - there was no way to get them up-front information before speaking directly about what the user would like so it didn't actually exist yet either, since these services have already had to wait until later on. \n\nThere can only really ever be 100+ assistants who've logged into a particular company through an API and worked alongside eachother via social media to coordinate something such as getting an appointment booked between those accounts and scheduling some service which involves booking said service over text/phone from a human agent instead of opening up their own web interface to book a new client right now... There are lots of different systems being used nowadays for many tasks: if you need somebody immediately, don't let yourself forget anything else that might require interaction when working offline (such as updating status online), try calling them again within five minutes to give time to deal with any unanswered calls.

There are actually quite a number of names used at different times to differentiate between different versions of the same person, so people often refer to him only once all over YouTube in a completely interchangeable set of videos.\nPopeye Jones / Gaston Lee - Both men named Porgie came up with unique characters in their careers. In particular, Popeyes would bring out carts full of Popeyes Cracklots to feed hungry customers while other restaurants simply served fries on white plastic plates instead of offering burgers. They'd be found in several early fight scenes of the 1940s and early 1950s alongside fellow Brooklynites Rocky Balboa before ending their days respectively. \n\nAs an addendum, you can use Chuck when trying to sell someone a gun because the idea of punching somebody just doesn't have many equivalents elsewhere within popular culture.<|endoftext|>",

A dark forest encircled both kingdoms where deadly spells and wizardly might was wielded in mortal combat while brave men rode out to face off each other over unmapped battlefields. \n\nYet these two groups could not hope to match each other; there were no swords or bows among their foes. And they would surely be overcome at last...if only the mighty Dragon Wurm did not lay claim upon one small village which he had been guarding until it came into his hands once again after a long time. \n\nFor though this town-house belonged not so much to any noble house as rather to a wealthy peasant farmer whose home had fallen down during some disastrous plague outbreak when most everyone else died in a blaze of fire or lightning, yet despite her wealth she knew very little about warfare since even now many things needed more careful tending than others - for instance the new fields beyond this tiny settlement should never have grown too lush unless the grasses were fed by wild herbs found deep within the surrounding hillsides, for without such vegetation nearby villagers grew weary and lost interest quickly because it became impossible to farm without horses' help -- indeed if ever the poor peasants saw that herb growing wild beside the road near the houses, then soon the roadside crops must yield next season\u2019s harvest.

It was discovered that there are regions in the brain called \"receptive fields\" dedicated to visual processing, and these areas are especially sensitive to specific parts of faces and body. However, some scientists believe this might not be true for all species. For instance, in chimpanzees, humans, macaques, baboons, gorillas, elephants, dogs, cows, cats, dolphins, parrots, penguins, sea lions, etc., certain areas in their brains seem specifically adapted to particular behaviors\u2014in many cases those involve recognizing faces! In addition, it turns out that one region may be specialized just for remembering an animal's face but not its voice.

However it will likely happen faster depending on what sort of wildlife is feeding on it, where you live, how fast wind blows and even how many young are left alive in its stomachs.\nThis depends somewhat upon other factors but the main point is: the smaller it is compared to your target prey item the greater the delay between meal and takeoff until both birds have reached adulthood; similarly bigger things generally get eaten quicker too, unless something really bad happens and all birds suddenly go crazy.\nFor example here are pictures comparing several sizes of two-winged crows taken around 20 minutes apart (source _URL_1_):\n[A](_URL_2_) - A pair about 30 minutes apart ~~at first~~  or one minute earlier, showing larger wingspans due to shorter flight distance, much slower growth rates, and no apparent weight difference because there wasn't any blood loss or mortality after parturition during either phase (iirc crows are fairly good climbers despite having longer wings",

This may change if they get larger or cost effective though, as then it could be economically viable.

            "The Katanas were very important for many reasons. The biggest one was that they had been used as a sword by various Asian cultures since ancient times, and there are numerous historical references to them being weapons of war or defense. In Japan's history they were almost always worn on their left side with long hair tied back and carried at all times (the same way the samurai wore their kimonos). \n\nHowever, while there is no official rule against carrying your own swords around, some people chose not to do so because it made sense for someone who couldn't afford a proper weapon, especially if you could still use others effectively. There also didn't seem like an obvious choice for people living off rice paddies when they needed something stronger than simple sticks and poles, but instead those types of weapons were often chosen over longer blades simply due to personal preference. This sort of thing happens quite frequently among Samurai themselves: after having learned how effective these shorter knives can be against larger animals, soldiers might opt to carry other kinds of slashing tools such as chopsticks, rather than using even more powerful fighting swords. They're just easier to control overall, and don't tend to leave much residue behind once dropped from their grasp.<|endoftext|>",
            "The sword was considered \"samurai-class\" weapon.  This is not meant to be an indication of its high quality, but rather that it used by those who were part of military and/or aristocratic classes (in Japan).  That said, I think that's more due to historical context than anything else.\n\nKatsura (which means 'war blade') came from Okinawa prefecture around 900 CE - this is very similar to where [Samurai](_URL_1_) originated as well.  In fact, there are some similarities between how they fight, use weapons, etc..   As you can see below:\n\n > There were many types of blades available for sale or exchange; among them were swords like bokuto (wooden), wakizashi (iron) and sashimi (steel) which would be traded with other regions while travelling. In addition, some parts had been made into swords such as kamae (wood) hilted sabers, mabuni (bone) ones and naginata (metal) handles. This gave rise to what we call today the Samurai class. \n > \n\n > The Samurai also wore distinctive clothes worn specially during the day time called chugai (cloth) belts or gatemen (belt covering). At night these usually consisted of one large belt (called kimyuga(literally, black cloth)) and multiple smaller belts at waist level (known as gaten). A small number of samurai may sometimes wear their hair long (a practice known as shaggy hairstyles). They may also carry swords on both right and left sides only when necessary (the same tradition has existed since ancient times.) Their sleeves could either reach up over the elbows or down towards the stomach.\n > \n\n > To make themselves look more impressive and intimidating to others, most samurais carried two large shields painted red (reddish) inside each"

            "The kamikaze were basically suicide bombers, so I doubt that Katanas can be classified as a \"high-tech\" weapon. When Samurais needed to commit heists at night or on isolated areas during invasions and raids against Yamato troops/militias (it was only later that they used spears and arrows), there wasn't an effective high tech alternative besides a wooden sword for heavy armor of medium quality but not very good enough to cut through chains of enemy soldiers who'd wear better heavier armour. \n\nAlso this is just more speculation though. It seems unlikely that most Japanese katana's would've been able to penetrate chain mail like those worn by Hachiman samurai. That makes them seem useless as well, it should rather appear they are less deadly than typical swords from such era (that I know anyway). But again...just my personal opinions. Hope I helped!<|endoftext|>",
            "So it is not so much about why Samurais used swords, but rather how they were made. The sword itself was actually *much* bigger than any Japanese handhold or spear head could handle and I'm talking as big as two long poles!  You know those old TVs with one pole on either side of the screen that give you a picture to see what's going on behind them?  Well these would be like that. \n\nIn Japan during the Edo era there were basically two kinds: \"Shinrei\" (\"traditional craftsmen\") and Shonin (literally meaning master craftsman). Shinenji (or shimenai) usually focused on making certain types of metal weapons such as arrows and spears which weren't widely available outside their country; however all sorts of wood-cutting tools came out including sabers from many different species as well as many new ones added into the traditional Japanese style. These included some interesting techniques - using tree trunks for both blades and lances at very specific points along the shaft to control where they are pointing when cutting/hitting things together. So if this didn't make sense already... think [of trying to explain to someone who isn't sure whether 'fancy' just means a lot more complex technique]\n\n This whole approach worked because most people learned by watching skilled swordsmiths working away day after day - even without knowledge of swordsmanship as an art. They also understood basic principles which made training and learning easy enough for the general population. \n\n When Samurai went through some sorta apprenticeship period involving a number of other men copying designs onto blank leaves then they started getting lessons on proper execution/use etc and finally had their own specialized classes called Ryojuro-zoku where they picked up their practice skills alongside the trained soldiers in case they ever fell ill.

But in my opinion, the book just works on its own terms with an emotional payoff rather than as part of any bigger whole narrative (that would include plot twists) and the main characters themselves make us sympathize deeply enough with their situations without needing a major plot twist or resolution after two-thirds through. This feels much more grounded within these familiar elements while also giving plenty of room for development along those same lines later in the novel, so I don\u2019t think it could be faulted by being overly complicated when done right!  The prose flows naturally between the scenes of events unfolding but there's never a feeling like a \u201cone paragraph rule\u201d or \u201cfive minute scene rule.\u201d Each page seems designed carefully and deliberately and I'm glad to say I enjoyed every second spent reading them even though they took me nearly five hours each from beginning to end; sometimes long books need shorter reads to really hit the pulse rate!  This may sound too negative since your first few chapters did not contain any huge plot twists (or other surprises), however the reader should always appreciate a strong writing style where no single line stands out uninspiringly alone; there are lots of tiny little things here that give this tale great life yet keep the reader moving forward quickly, especially the author himself whose writing was extremely polished throughout and gave a natural flow that helped him avoid many mistakes which were almost impossible for a writer such as myself to spot early on during editing stages due to lack of attention to detail.

So that person's image remains for 1 year, if someone broke the mirror (for example), his name will show up at least once more, as long as there were other mirrors nearby to replace them. \nThere are some exceptions, but mostly those with names only showed their first letter from \"your\" side so that won't happen often. But sometimes even one broken glass breaks through because an individual may want others not know they've been broken before they're aware  it might take several weeks or months till we realize that someone actually got our address. In case people did get addresses though (such as when a car gets stuck between two walls), they'd find out eventually via a call center like many states do. There is no exact rule saying whether such an event takes place each day; every morning a few cars go missing which usually results in police checking everyone\u2019s address. It is however very rare these days that a mirror does break itself without a warning by another party, meaning all those affected are automatically told about the accident soon enough by local media, news channels etc.. \n\nNow lets see why there could also still be 7 'bad' years after being shown/heard /broken the mirror... This time round most would have noticed right away, unless there were reasons beyond simple coincidence like weather change due to high humidity and thus low air pressure (or similar effects). And again there should never really exist any real chance that the 7 years happens again: Even during periods of severe rain (rain falling almost instantaneously) wind and clouds will affect light-based clocks much less than mechanical ones since sunlight reaches objects within half an hour (this doesn't work perfectly for daylight times, though): \n\n > As mentioned earlier, a solar clock operates 24 hours a day around noon under",

There are no actual events occurring but we still think, based on how we remember them being reported as well, like [the case](_URL_0_) where they had two sets of doors with different mirrors inside so the ones who went outside ended up seeing double... And since then these sorts of stories continue without question by the few that choose to listen and follow them, and often times become a sort of clich\u00e9 or joke which doesn\u2019t mean anything until enough of us get tired and lose interest anyway.... But all jokes aside\u2026 So basically everyone just makes assumptions based on what we recall as history repeating itself, but does little else except hope its somehow possible! (This goes against our current beliefs though, and actually could be argued for saying more.) \n\nAs an example consider a couple things here - the \u201cseven-year\u201d theory, or one set of five windows in your home opening/closing at various intervals throughout a single night while the other 5 don\u2019t open / close because the day was sunny etc; each individual person will do his best, over thousands upon millions of cycles during that month.  However the only way we ever hear this particular story is told within certain circles - many decades ago before radio broadcast news came into play. If the numbers aren\u2019t familiarized yet to us it\u2019s because of how many years of silence surround these numbers themselves now and were known by people prior to recording history and having a name associated with it such as [George Washington\u201d, Thomas Jefferson or Benjamin Franklin.]("

You'll also become familiarized with techniques such as layering and blending, which have been proven useful throughout history.

That tells them how quickly the current heating will change between periods - say, when the room gets warmer than 40 degrees Fahrenheit, they'll probably get all \"hot\" right away; after two hours, though, they may have cooled down enough so they won't stay completely warm anymore without additional cooling. \n\nBut more importantly, those specific cycles depend upon very small differences between successive timescales. If you use constant-current loads, such as motors driving pumps directly, the time scales involved become enormous compared to real life - even if you could somehow predict just *how* large these scale shifts would occur, doing lots of little updates over many years wouldn't help because they'd never really come into play before the next big shift occurred. But once you've got your fans working constantly through thousands of minutes per second, it becomes incredibly easy to add extra complexity that adds exponentially more delay.<|endoftext|>",
            "The idea of using proportional controllers for controlling these types of systems is not entirely new. However, it has been used widely only recently (see this paper) where there was a real-world example of its use as well as previous work on computer control theory which shows how they can improve performance at low cost/effort compared to more complex solutions like proportional-integral-derivative controls. In particular, such approaches have demonstrated significant improvements over fixed gain proportional-integral-derivative controllers due to their ability to track disturbances accurately while reducing both effort required and response time from tens of milliseconds up to hundreds of milliseconds depending upon system size. The key benefits come down to:\n* Accuracy \u2013 tracking small changes quickly requires no fine tuning;  large changes require careful control because even slight miscalculations result in large swings in output\n\n * Robustness \u2013 given any input disturbance, the system will remain stable regardless of initial conditions, making them ideal candidates for applications requiring robustness against various external factors - such as temperature fluctuations, wind speeds, etc.;  and accurate enough to avoid causing excessive power consumption during transient operation\n\n * Reduced computational complexity \u2013 proportional gains usually involve multiplying quantities while integral terms may also require solving differential equations to find values within limits defined by the problem domain. This makes computing proportional gains very slow particularly if you're dealing with highly dynamic feedback systems\n* Highly modularity \u2013 typically, each proportional element must interact via different feedback mechanisms so that additional elements added later would still communicate effectively with earlier ones through those interfaces \n\n >   \u201cThese results show that digital proportional control offers great advantages over conventional methods of electronic control design,\u201d said coauthor Charles Moyer of the University of California Los Angeles Department of Mechanical Engineering. \u201cBy combining linear and nonlinear algorithms we were able to reduce the number of components needed for high-performance controlled ventilation systems without sacrificing accuracy.\u201d<|endoftext|>"

However I am sure there would have been numerous trade offs involved if people had simply chosen those methods over using dedicated controllers so instead of being dependent on one piece of equipment the whole room may require a huge range of controls with many compromises built into each unit.

But this isn't always easy because there may be more than two (or even all three) of them, causing each fan to operate very differently depending on what it's pushing around inside.\n\nA typical factory for me has five different machines set up as follows:\n\n    Machine 1 -- All workstations from 4/5 together.  This machine controls 5 shafts, plus 3 separate pistons for each bearing. The whole stack weighs about 100k pounds; most of these bearings require no lubrication to function properly so you don't notice the noise if they wear out before you can service them.\n\n   2  -- 10 of these shafts control the same amount of force, but do different jobs. Here you're using differential drive which means only one motor (that we care about here). \n\n     3  -- 20 shafts control different amounts of resistance, with six having half the mass. These motors will give us \"lift,\" meaning they'll allow less engine power than they would otherwise, since they produce thrust through friction instead of creating lift directly. Each motor usually works independently, and won't mix without proper attention to redundancy. \n\n        4 - 12 shafts controlled by another 2 that also serve as pistons for all those above-mentioned units (and probably others I've forgotten.) Now let's say two motors happen to run exactly parallel while the rest still produce some work as well. This causes your system to lose a lot of efficiency because one unit loses its ability to move, the balance gets wobbly and eventually locks, or something goes wrong with individual gears somewhere. If each shaft moves individually enough, it might cause instability if any part was damaged somehow, though how often that'd occur without redundancy doesn't matter too much except for maybe a bad transmission or gearbox if it happens over time anyway. Or not much damage could easily happen either: after a minute of spinning slowly along in reverse"

This type of control has been used extensively in industry for decades now because they're simple enough to use without needing any complex maths.  The PI controller will have two inputs - the desired output and the actual output which can be calculated from the input values.  It's also easy to set up so that if there isn't much variation between the outputs over time, this means that the system doesn't run out of power very quickly.\n\nHowever, if you want something more robust than just keeping the fan going forever, then you'll probably want to look into a differential-algebraic (DAQ) controller.  These types of controllers require lots of complicated mathematics but don't really care about how fast the fan runs; instead, they only care about whether the difference between the current value and the previous value is small enough that it makes sense to change the state of the system based on those differences.  They do all sorts of fancy stuff like calculating derivatives and integrals etc., but these kinds of controllers tend not to work well under real world conditions where the variations aren't too big.<|endoftext|>"

This also applies to new-incoming values from the front, which have already been processed before arriving at their current location. The algorithm tries first if this case occurs; it can be improved by sorting them into blocks according to the desired behavior: If the number is larger than two then move forward one position in that direction while removing less recent ones, or remove both. Then move backwards as much more recently updated value goes away with every other step. <|endoftext|>",

In our example that will probably involve an integer value stored somewhere (probably using some kind of pointer or hash table), then after retrieving it from memory you need only call levenshtein_distance(key1, key2).

            "Here's an explanation of the basic principle behind it:\n\n1) Start with a list. This is how we get all our information about items that aren't yet in our inventory (in this case, food). We'll use the first item as an example; if I'm not mistaken there are two things to consider here, which are \"size\" and \"weight\". Size determines how many calories or other units you need for cooking purposes. Weight tells us how heavy something is. The idea is that when we have some amount of weight/calories, then we can calculate what kind of food would be good for someone who weighs more than we do - say, 150 pounds. That way we don't make them eat too much junky stuff like bread and pasta, because they'd just go crazy trying to consume those things instead of eating healthy foods. It also helps keep the price low since fewer people will buy them at full price so they won't run out before everyone else.\n2) Next up is the list itself. If we've already got one thing listed above (food), we want to find another thing from the same set. Let me give you my favorite method for doing this: sort by size and count the number of times it occurs within each category. For instance, let's take apples:\n\nSize 1: Apples\n\nWeight 5\nNumber of times found 2\nTotal calories 3 ~~3*5 = 15\nPrice 0\n\nSo now we know everything except the weight. Now we're going to add the weights again but only once per product, and compare their sizes against our previous results, making sure to include any products whose weight was less than ours (so that means smaller ones were included twice). Then we check whether these numbers match up between categories:\n\n    Apples >  Apple + Apple-apple\n        =       6   =>  4\n         <       7     =>  8 \n           >       9      "

            "So your audience is going to listen with their ears and eyes?  Your message needs to hit all three areas of attention: 1) The benefits 2) Why we should take action now (in this case investment). \n\n1a) Benefits - This would include any actual tangible things that you could provide like new furniture or technology that improves productivity by reducing time spent doing mundane tasks. This doesn't necessarily have to do with human resource costs but does mean \"more money\" because these improvements can save us more dollars overall. For example if I'm trying to get some equipment installed into our warehouse then having something less visible than a hammer/screwdriver makes sense since there's not much else required; however if we don't need it and want to keep everything pretty cheaply, just using a screwdriver instead lets us accomplish the same thing in less space. Also even though someone may know what they're talking about better than themselves, this still shows them how useful knowledge and experience can really help increase productivity without increasing overheads. As well, once again the goal here isn't to make money off workers, rather it's to improve quality of work which saves both resources and cash. \n2) Health - Now most likely one reason why companies are investing in such investments is to see whether the benefit outweighs the risk involved. Well from what little research I've done regarding workplace injuries over recent years (and reading through numerous articles, forums etc.) its quite clear that working environments that encourage employees to spend too many hours sitting around in front of computers tend to result in significant amounts of back pain, lower back strain, increased levels of fatigue and decreased performance across different demographics within an organization due to stress related illnesses, lack of physical activity, poor nutrition, general malnourishment and chronic boredom. There has also been substantial evidence showing that certain jobs perform worse when individuals aren\u2019t properly protected against hazards, including falls, repetitive lifting, prolonged standing and exposure to high temperatures during work",

You might be spending less energy than before, but you will still have accomplished the tasks required by the organization for which you were hired: making new clients/clients happier via better sales records, meeting deadlines set forth within budgets and budget constraints, etc...  This means that while your coworkers might not necessarily enjoy being yelled at 5 AM every day, there's no reason this won't change over time based on where you want to go from here: whether toward promotion/leads, salary increases/bonuses, or improved performance at your current role and beyond. While stress levels may vary depending on position, it doesn't matter very much what is going on outside of these walls - once you're focused exclusively on accomplishing specific objectives, you'll get stronger than others who don't focus on these things. \n\n\n\tThink bigger picture....think \"why should I feel like my job is worthwhile?\" In other words, if *you* see yourself improving quality products and services offered within your workplace (or expanding customer base) because those companies appreciate your hard work AND are willing to pay money above market rates for the skills you possess (as opposed to any vague sense of \"what am I trying to accomplish\")...then **that** might actually make you happy!

            "This is actually a very important question! I\u2019ll start by looking at some of the different ways that we can think about and discuss how to answer this one:\n\n* The benefits and drawbacks of each type of workplace furniture\n\nThere are two main types of workplace furniture that you should consider when trying to find the right product: ergonomically-friendly products such as ergonomic chairs or desks, and those which focus more heavily on providing physical comfort like ergonomic rolling stands or standing desks. While these might look nice aesthetically (which may seem obvious), they don't offer any tangible benefits beyond their aesthetic appeal - both because they're not necessarily meant to improve your posture, but also due to their inherent complexity, and high costs compared to other options. For example, while ergonomic rolling stands often come with built-in cushions to help alleviate pressure points during sitting/lying down, if you need them regularly, they typically require replacement parts from companies like Caterpillar who specialize in manufacturing equipment used primarily for construction projects; the total investment involved in buying these parts is usually significantly higher than what you would pay elsewhere for similar pieces made specifically for office use. In addition, there's always going to be something unique and innovative added to every piece, so finding someone willing to manufacture all kinds of fancy features and materials just isn't practical without incurring significant overhead expenses.\n\nIn contrast, offices have been designed around traditional office chair technology, which allows us to build incredibly comfortable chairs with simple design principles rather than requiring complex engineering. These include wide armrests and low back support which provides greater freedom of movement for workers and makes working conditions less stressful. Additionally, these chairs allow for users to move around comfortably without having to constantly reposition themselves using the desk mechanism; this reduces fatigue levels through improved balance, reducing muscle tension, improving concentration levels and allowing users to sit quietly even for extended periods of time. As far as productivity goes, many office",
            "The most important thing about this is that you have to show them how they can benefit from these changes by using the tools and technology available today. Additionally, if there are any benefits associated with making your job easier or more comfortable then it\u2019s up to them whether or not to do so. In other words, what kind of productivity gains could be made through better equipment? Could there also be greater quality of life improvements because of such innovations? This should help determine which products would actually make sense for use inside a workplace setting, and perhaps even justify purchasing some additional gear to keep costs down! \nTo answer the second question first: I believe the reason behind employee satisfaction is related to several factors including individual comfort levels (for example, physical fitness), ability level, attitude toward work, knowledge regarding their duties, skills needed to perform those duties, etc. There might also be others like experience or motivation reasons influencing employees' feelings towards various items. The only way we know anything about it is if someone provides us evidence that shows actual measurable outcomes linked directly to one's behavior over time. \n\nSo here's the best part... You don't need much proof before investing into things that improve productivity. For instance, I am confident that [my company has invested in improving ergonomics](_URL_0_) throughout all areas of our operation; this includes adding new computer stations and moving old ones out of rooms where workers spend less than five minutes per day. Other examples include providing access to printers, scanners, fax machines, projectors, computers, etc., as well as offering high-quality desks and chairs along with a wide range of safety devices to reduce falls.  This is just the tip of the iceberg - I'd love to hear what other types of advantages exist besides \"more efficiency\" that employers seek when choosing offices.<|endoftext|>"

Now both have learned their own set of rules which will determine how well these three things relate together. And those rule sets get applied until all possible combinations end up in either X1 = 4 or 9.

            "> Why not just make an ANN for it to figure out if I have one thing or another based on some signal input from my hands/arm. If there's something that the network should pick up and decide is worth paying attention to, why bother having multiple different things all in different locations when each one could probably give me exactly the same result (except they'd be connected to a completely separate processor).\n\nI don't understand your point about the fact you're getting *different* results by using more than 1 of those nodes... But let me clarify what we mean: An \"ANN\" works best as a computer model that takes in inputs from lots of data sources (the ones with known outcomes), runs a series of simple computations on them to generate output, then tries again.  A good analogy would be someone saying they wanted a system to determine how often you got the correct answer during an exam -- say whether it was three wrongs and four rights; this wouldn't really work very well unless people were being honest at least somewhat often so you could take feedback from the process rather than trying to get a precise score themselves every time you went back and looked through the questions again (or perhaps try doing math while waiting outside and counting incorrect answers); instead you want something like this which allows people who aren't perfect even to come close.  But no matter what number-calculating mechanism is used in these types of models, there will always exist ways for their outputs to vary widely from input signals due either to random error in calculating certain variables (as occurs whenever a person gives the same set of instructions over and over without considering possible changes between repeats) or systematic errors inherent to computing mechanisms.\n\n > And can it ever happen where I know ahead of time exactly which way to move to advance into new information because its easier for a trained algorithm to keep track of said information once learned (instead of requiring thousands of hours spent training before figuring it out)... but since i am now asking",
            "In fact, this is why it's so common for computers to \"learn\" by making mistakes. For example in [this article](_URL_0_) you'll find an example of how one AI algorithm could make incorrect decisions (when trained on millions of images). It just took thousands or tens of thousands of image data points before the program got the idea that they should move up/down depending upon their color value - even if the underlying algorithm doesn't tell them exactly which way they should move at all times. \n\nThat being said there are also algorithms and models that learn through experience - some more like this than others: _URL_1_, etc...<|endoftext|>"

            "This is why we need biases, but it's not just for \"learning\". The same principle works with other kinds of computation too.\n\nA simple example would be if you want to know the average speed of cars in different parts of an intersection: You could record their position at every moment and then compare them against some baseline data like where they were last year (to make sure there aren't any new trends that have been added recently). This allows us to measure how much time passes between two successive points in space by recording each car's location relative to another car which can be measured on your phone or laptop (assuming all roads are level/leveled), etc.\n\nIf I had my way this would happen constantly instead of once per second; when I say continuously, I mean the computer will keep adding numbers up until one arrives so that no error accumulates as far as you're concerned. In practice, computers work differently though because of errors - it doesn't matter what order the calculations take place in, as long as the final result agrees exactly with our expectation, i.e. everything is going right, then whatever else happens should also go perfectly according to our expectations. If the first step has problems, things start getting screwed up from there, making mistakes appear even more frequent than normal, until eventually everything looks correct and you've achieved perfect accuracy!<|endoftext|>",

However, if we assume that one is \"biased\" by the other and so the first weight becomes less significant when applied on top of the second, then this leads us back to the original question: Why are they different (not necessarily biased) from how we usually see them?\n\nIt turns out it's because these networks are being used in machine learning where all of their parameters must fit together very well before training begins; but even here, I don't think there needs to be an extra parameter added for something like the biases since any errors made during data generation can be corrected after processing.<|endoftext|>"

First, you look at its market cap:\n\nIf $100 million dollars were sitting on Coinbase\u2019s balance sheet (the most popular and easiest way for people to buy or sell crypto), it would have a total market capitalization of $10 billion dollars \u2014 more than any other stock I know of that has this property! So, we say there is \u201ca\u201d bitcoin, with a current price of around $1000 per coin; if one bitcoin was worth ten thousand dollars today, then our \u201cone\u201d bitcoin might be worth between 10x-$1 and 10000000-10^15000. This means each new bitcoin added to the chain increases the overall value by an exponential factor. If we had a list of all coins in circulation as of March 30th, 2017, the latest block included five Bitcoin.\n\nNow, here\u2019s where things get complicated\u2026 When looking at prices, there is always some uncertainty because these markets change so fast. There will be many small corrections from time to time during which traders try to guess what their future movements may turn out to be based on past performance and/or trends over the long term. As such, the average estimate for the value of every single bitcoin currently available could range anywhere from several hundred cents up to thousands of times greater than actual monetary wealth. To simplify matters, let\u2019s use just a hypothetical example. Let\u2019s assume the average person knows that buying 100 BTC at $2,500 each day creates an additional net gain of 500% of their initial investment when compared to buying only 0.5 BTC. We want to see exactly what that gains looks like. Now, if the buyer buys 100*0.25 = 20000 coins now vs 5 BTC, they win the game! That doesn\u2019t mean those who bought 4BTC earlier didn\u2019t also profit but it does make them slightly less wealthy. In fact, given",

A good example would be bitcoin and hashing functions like SHA256(hash_function() * salt + hash_function()). You do this many times until your hash function returns 0. Then all you have left are numbers called bitcoins.

The reason that you need to beat the eggy thing first before adding water/butter/etc is because this makes for more even layers in your cake so there's no white on top of yellow when baked, or if you use whole milk instead of cream cheese, those are going to be lighter coloured due to lack of fat-soluble colourants like blue food dye. So not only will you have less cakes to mix up but also the batter has been cooked *very* thoroughly without any excess moisture remaining, meaning fewer pockets where extra can happen during baking.\n\nThis means the resulting pancakes tend to be darker colours initially compared to normal pancakes. But once they've cooled down enough to cook properly you'll notice how these lightest areas look pale compared to their darker spots; the same goes for chocolate and banana slices too. \n\nAside from flavour differences though, what makes these particular batches taste better is probably a combination of lots of factors. One big factor would likely be how long ago your last \"proper\" pancake was made: If you haven't used all the batter out of the fridge since, say...the weekend, you may find yourself having trouble achieving the right consistency.\n\nAnother could simply be the amount of time people put in making each individual portion.

            "They don't have a good way to control what's happening inside them, and that leads to things going wrong. So there isn't just one single cause at play for it, but two:\n1)  First thing you notice when your pan gets hot is a difference in surface area; they can take on more water (the amount will vary from batter-to-batter). That causes steam/condensation - this creates \"flavors\" within each individual cake (this may not be as pronounced in white bread or something similar).\n2) Second, you know that those cakes are made out of air, which makes some parts heavier than others (so even though most surfaces aren't covered by wax/lard paper these tend to be higher quality compared with less dense stuff like wheat flour etc.) \n\nIt takes a lot of energy and heat input into turning them all into fat bubbles around an open gas space... This doesn't really make sense unless we think about the overall structure and size of each part individually (in the end its kind of a bit arbitrary because we need certain proportions for every ingredient used, but let's assume the basic shape anyway...)<|endoftext|>",
            "Firstly, if you don't use any flour then there is no need for browning. You will still have some sort of white color from using the fat (I am not sure how that's defined), but I'm going to assume it is in part because when a large amount of starch/cellulose dissolves and becomes sugar it gets more readily converted into sugars. \n\nIf your pancake batter isn't fully absorbed before you start adding oil/butter to get that initial browing done - i.e. all your butter or eggs are now in liquid form, the process of absorption begins, however, which also makes it harder for excess heat/sauce on the surface of your pancakes as well. So the result being: first the fats turn yellow-orange at high temperature while absorbing enough energy from those hot bubbles; second they're \"pancaked\" until almost entirely melted down and absorb less heat per time. This causes them to lose moisture fast since they contain mostly water instead of sugar/bases/protein so even after boiling their edges aren't very firm. They cook pretty quickly too with an extremely short cooking period where none would normally happen, hence why people think these cakes burn quicky!<|endoftext|>"

Glutamate is one of several amino acids involved with protein folding. In addition to making more complex molecules like enzymes and hormones, glutamate also has roles as a neurotransmitter in our brain; this makes sense when we think about how important neurotransmitters are for survival because they allow us to focus on tasks while not overtaxing or depleting our energy reserves.

It's not going to be any different than if it was unfolded from start-to-finish. So why would this change things so drastically? Well for two reasons: 1) You don't really want to cook more than 2/3rds at time because there will still be some leftover heat when you flip them, which will cause the whole thing to burn. This means you're probably better off just flipping them after they come out of the oven; but also note that even though they aren't fully cooked yet they may end up with residual moisture, so it might actually taste pretty good without being burnt.<|endoftext|>",

You'll need people who know precisely what each machine does very well, since one faulty component will ruin millions of dollars worth of production.

            "There are a number of techniques used by psychologists to determine whether people can distinguish between faces or objects. A face-matching task involves matching pairs of pictures taken from different views so that one is seen as belonging either to the person with whom the pair was paired or someone else. For example, when two pictures are shown on screen side-by-side for 20 seconds each (for 30 seconds total), it\u2019s likely they will match because there should be an equal probability that both photos would look similar at first glance if not being presented next together  \n_URL_0_\n\n The main reason we do this type of testing now has little to nothing to do with \"cognitive science.\" In psychology's worldview, it all stems from some very early observations made long ago by the French mathematician Ren\u00e9 Descartes [1544]. His initial experiment showed us just how easily human perception can shift away from familiar information, but his original question wasn't what he found interesting - instead it had much more to do with our capacity for categorization and mental mapping; we can tell things apart despite knowing almost none about them, yet know quite well their general relationship, such as 'horse' and 'elephant'. \n\n Another important technique involved the use of priming, where stimuli change before coming into view while participants see no changes to the images themselves -- meaning there really isn't any cognitive effect.<|endoftext|>",
            "There are several different types of people that work as engineers. There's a whole lot to the way we build things so I won't get into them here - they're just important aspects which come up every now and then (though there are also more esoteric reasons).\n\nIn order to start building an object it must first be built on paper using metal and clay; these make use of chemicals like lead, silver, iron, nickel etc for alloying. Once all the elements have been put together by welding or gluing (using some type of chemical glue), those pieces are placed inside a machine called an electric arc furnace where a special type of hot air is forced through tubes containing glowing embers which produce gases at around 3000\u00b0C, above 1,000 \u00b0C depending upon whether or not they were melted. Those gas particles act like magnets causing steel parts made with these kinds of furnaces to be pushed against each other while heated up to higher temperatures (called annealing) where new bonds can form between two steel sections before cooling again and forming new welds until eventually one part is completed enough times such that the other will match exactly but isn't too big to handle/make a tool out of when cooled off afterwards. When the piece is finished the result has got something akin to \"rubbing paint\" from having all sorts of little grooves and pits formed across its surface thanks to heat generated during this process (although since none of those marks exist when working in nature the resulting surfaces may appear very rough and scratchy.) This painting takes time though, especially if lots of tiny flaws are found over time and only needs one small mark created at the end because even smaller imperfections will show themselves due to wear down as the layers separate slightly and don't always align properly, however many areas of large gaps might still look quite nice! So yeah: the whole idea was probably started sometime about 1845 and refined after World War 2 based mainly on experiments carried out back home, but essentially"

            "Sure. I can give a detailed explanation on the basics of my approach to data analysis (see below). But for this answer I need some background information from someone who is familiar with your research.\n\nThe main idea behind your question is that we are not really sure why people have these preferences or tendencies towards specific food types over others. For example, there may be something called \"food addiction\" which suggests an underlying biological basis. This could mean one thing: our brains reward certain kinds of eating behavior by rewarding those foods more than other foods. However, if we look closer at what makes us eat, it turns out that most of our eating comes down to habituation -- when our brain learns to respond differently depending on whether the taste has been pleasurable before. We also learn about food habits through conditioning experiments where we put mice into different cages with different diets. The animals will then go back and forth between their preferred diet and its non-preferred diet until the experimenters decide they like both! \n\nThis phenomenon is called [habituation](_URL_2_) and it occurs across many areas of learning including perception, memory, attention, emotion, and motivation; but as far as I know no one had ever looked specifically at the neural mechanisms involved. It seems likely, however, that such processes play a role in determining food preference. Habits tend to develop gradually rather than suddenly. Thus even if we cannot directly measure the exact nature of any particular mechanism responsible for food choice, we do know enough about the way our brains make choices about food and drink to hypothesize that the process involves some sort of decision-making circuitry similar to the ones implicated in making decisions about social status and gender roles. In fact there was quite recently a study done using fMRI that demonstrated activity patterns associated with various aspects of food consumption in humans during emotional states.  I don't believe this is related to any kind of food addiction because I'm not aware of anything resembling addictive behaviour being observed here",
            "Hi,\nI can answer this question with a few simple examples. The most important thing is that the process of learning to code should be fun! It's not like playing an endless game of tic tac toe or anything like that; it has to have a purpose. So let me start by explaining what I mean by \"fun\". Lets say we are going on a trip and want to go somewhere interesting but also safe (like a park for some reason). We decide that since there are lots of different parks out there, we will just choose a random one. Now if someone else had said, lets pick a park where everyone knows each other, then all they would need to do is tell us which one they think is coolest, so no matter who goes first, everybody wins! That way, whoever chooses the best place does better than those without knowledge about it beforehand because nobody needs to guess at their own destination. If you don't care too much about winning, though, it could still be good to know your friends' locations as soon as possible before starting off from them - that way when you get lost, you'll already have a pretty clear idea of where you're headed! \n\nSo now, here comes my second example: When people learn new languages, they usually try very hard to remember every single word/letter in it. For instance, when learning German, I'm sure many people thought up a lot more complicated sentences, such as: \"Ich habe eine Karte geholt\", instead of \"Ich habe ein kleines Papier gesehen\" (The book was opened), etc... However, once you become fluent in English, these kind of things are easy enough to forget after only 2-3 weeks (or less depending on the amount of exposure) - even when you've learned everything you need to know, there isn't always room left inside your memory banks! To help overcome this challenge, researchers found something called *phonetic"

            "I'm not sure I can help.\n\nThe first thing to understand is that the brain has a lot of different types of neurons (called \"types\" because they are like cells). Each type of neuron has its own function: some have an excitatory effect on other neurons; others inhibit them. The most important ones for this question are called \"excitatory\", since they cause action potentials (\"spikes\") when activated by electrical signals from another cell or tissue. \n\nThere's also inhibitory neurons which don't do anything but stop firing if there isn't enough current flowing through it. These aren't really useful here though - we're interested only in excitatory/inhibitory neurons.\n\nNow, what happens with these neurons? Well, each one gets connected up into a network. This means that any given neuron will receive input from many other neurons. If two neurons fire at once, then their connections become stronger than those between themselves. So, if you want to know about the connection strength between two neurons, you need to look at all the inputs coming out of both of them. You'll find that sometimes more than one kind of signal comes out of either one of them! That's why we call such networks \"networks\".\n\nSo now let's say you've got a bunch of excitatory neurons and lots of inhibitory neurons. What does this mean? It means that whenever your brain receives information from somewhere else, it sends a spike to every single one of those neurons. And so, as long as there are still plenty of excitatory neurons around, the net result is that the whole system becomes active. In fact, even without any external stimulation, the activity level goes up until eventually no new excitation arrives anymore.\n\nThis process repeats itself over and over again, creating a pattern known as \"synchronization\": basically, the same set of neurons fires together very often, while the rest of the world stays silent.

You can also write things by using string interpolation, but this is less commonly used than you might be thinking since it's mostly for teaching people to read code or when writing \"log messages\" which don't need visual formatting so usually only show up onscreen.\n\nTo output your program's executable binary, you use #include <iostream> for std::cout, otherwise just standard includes work if you want to print from C/C++ programs (and you probably should). If you're writing low-level libraries that depend on user input being passed through as data into your app then a third option would involve directly passing commands to systemd for example (this uses its own C language called [libsystemd](_URL_2_) internally.)\n\nSo how does the machine know what type to call?  Most modern operating systems pass pointers (in a way) between executables to make sure they behave correctly. What does each pointer contain?  Each process has its own memory address for itself even though these processes have no direct memory contact other side of them until now.   In any case, those addresses could store strings with arbitrary length.

Some have a special interest in specific areas such as banking or software development but most do not (though many do). It also depends on what kind of knowledge they already possess which will influence their approach.\n\nSo for example the people who work at large financial institutions would likely spend a lot of time thinking through risks and threats from both inside and outside their organisations and trying to mitigate them against possible future events. However these days we see a very broad range of risk-mitigation approaches used by those working within this sector. There is no one 'best' way, everyone uses different methods depending on what their organisation does. This includes how much effort should go into analysing data, assessing vulnerabilities, developing strategies for dealing with problems that might arise, making decisions regarding whether an action should take place based upon its results. The end result could be that none of the above really matter though, since any given company can just say \"I think we're all doing OK\" when it comes down to deciding how best to respond to various potential threat situations.<|endoftext|>",

You might lose all of those casualties with very little effect because they were probably waiting for reinforcements to arrive while you went ahead firing everything up anyway...\n\nAs far as I'm aware there's never been any official attempt made to use it against Chinese carriers/aircraft carrier groups during wartime, although several countries have attempted such things using the concept.

So first, make your program self sufficient at the beginning so if somebody wants their own logging they don\u2019t have to call multiple handlers for every task (so imagine two methods, one uses \u201cconsole\u201d, another uses \u201clog\u201d\u2026). Then modify each handler to use higher level events. \n\nNow once these logic has been written all its needed to check if anything needs changing let us say function returns something bool type...then lets take a while over what kind of return value we would expect from it then implement some kind of factory pattern where the final output returned will either tell whats going on inside the function itself or give information about error conditions. The factories could look very similar to my previous examples; They just have name parameter(what exactly this mean depends on who will define how things should work), default string value (how much should matter), time setting (\u201cdo X,Y,Z only happens when Y > Z?\u201d means wait 1 minute\u201d), list iterator returning values to store result in this array), etc.. In the end everything got compiled together and called back as follows\n\n``logger.setLevel(__func__)\nprint(mystr + \"[%s]\".format(*[i[:2] for i in iterable])) #Warning : This implementation may cause unexpected behavior sometimes\n\nNow that all those classes have been defined and linked together we now need to link them again in",

They go after every single job that involves practicing law including private practice where there is no competition but instead only one firm doing all the work - which just happens because many companies pay them millions of dollars annually to do this kind of work while other guys use someone else's experience in order to bring clients down so paying the former makes sense.

You take notes during the lecture and go through the material again later when taking the exam. It might be just reading over what was said last time and going back over certain things. They can also ask questions that help them understand how everything works better/faster/more clearly if they were unable to explain before because they haven't done much research on the topic yet. This way you learn from other people doing exactly this thing without having to sit there and read books about law for 6+ hours!\n\nThe second type involves getting your hands dirty while studying hard and being able to actually write down answers instead of relying solely on memorization. Most courses focus more heavily on these 2nd level subjects but many students get really good at them even though most don't do anything extra beyond basic reading and writing skills.\n\nThis means that almost all law professors will teach something different each semester. There are several topics I think are very common in practice cases:\n\n * How to prepare yourself mentally so that you're ready for trial or argument in court\n * How to prepare evidence - especially if someone wants to argue against their own position or present another expert witness testimony\n * How to keep track of dates / deadlines and follow up with legal matters as needed<|endoftext|>",

In my case, I'm taking a non-LLM approach--I am doing what they call \"advanced reading\" so that's all there really is to learning about topics related to the law--but the other courses are mostly lectures given by professors who specialize in various fields such as economics/business/politics/econometrics/finance/international affairs/taxation/etc.--they don't necessarily focus exclusively on one area but instead teach the general subject matter across multiple areas. \n\nAs far as the content goes, most things taught by ALA schools are covered through books, webpages, YouTube videos, podcasts, and some even have their own dedicated section online. It seems obvious now after years of seeing people study this stuff just because someone was explaining something, but back then everyone did it wrong!

However given your post (which seems to mostly be asking questions about why TensorFlow works on CPUs) we should at least find out how much it costs to run each one and then decide if the price/performance of my answer will outweigh its cost.\n\nAs for what data is being trained - there's two ways to get different kinds of information from learning a new concept: visual representations such as images or text, or sound files - the latter can contain some semantic meaning while also having relatively large amounts of textual inputs. The type of info fed into the neural network might depend on whether the program only tries to learn abstract concepts like \"dog\" (a visual representation), or something more specific (\"garden\"), in fact the actual semantics needn't even exist once the abstract notion gets encoded by the algorithm somewhere else via one particular input format or another.\n\nFrom an execution point-of-view it really comes down to how many variables were specified when building up the machine architecture - i.e. how precisely do we want to encode our models' knowledge about objects represented graphically, where does the model fit them, etc., vs. how little data exactly was used during training time before the result reached memory limits. This is basically just a matter of how well a certain process happens already with regard to the model structure itself; since most processes require more effort compared to their theoretical counterparts there exists additional overhead depending on the kind of model, including higher performance requirements due to additional computation required per sample / class / feature.\n\n & #x200B;\n\n\n Data preparation\n\nFirst start off by preprocessing the raw data using any available software, e. g. either OpenCV  &   or Scikit-learn respectively. Then turn these raw image frames into 2D numpy arrays through np.reshape(...). Note especially dat",

So for instance the phrase could be [[X, \"[B]], [C, \"[D\"], \"[F\"]].\n - Words beginning with two consecutive lowercase characters may also start with an uppercase character (\"X12\") but only one such word per line.

This process is referred to as compiling, which refers specifically to writing an assembly language code for processing by a processor (like a CPU). The first stage of compilation involves creating a \"binary file\" containing all the information necessary to compile a particular piece of software. Compiling consists of executing each instruction one at a time, adding extra data if it's needed and then storing the result back together again on disk or memory. When you run this program, your processor reads everything from its input file, called a source document, which contains all the information about where to look when doing so, such as keywords, variables, and constant values. If no errors occur during compilation, it will create a binary executable file\u2014a collection of machine-readable instructions that are executed directly by the processor without further modifications by the programmer.<|endoftext|>",
            "A statically-typed programming language is one that provides the programmer control over its type system - which means it has no dynamic capabilities (like runtime variables or function callbacks) at all. It's usually called a \"compile time\" language because it only uses static types (i.e., data structures declared using specific syntax). These languages typically provide very limited support for loops, conditionals, variable assignments, etc.; they don't offer any sort of runtime capability beyond this. The difference between them and run-time languages such as C++ are their lack of garbage collection facilities. For example, if you want your computer to perform some task in the background while the application is running, then an interactive command shell might be what you need; otherwise, just use a text editor and keep pressing ENTER.\n\nAn interpreter is an execution engine where code is read from standard input/output streams, executed on the CPU, and returned back to the user via stdout/stderr (or equivalent); it doesn't give much flexibility in terms of how those outputs may differ when compared against other source codes. An interpreter also does not necessarily require complex compilation techniques since the output will still be quite simple - even though it takes longer than the initial compile stage. In fact, many interpreters allow users to specify additional functions to execute automatically depending upon certain conditions; see Python for example. They're often used together with a higher level scripting language or compiler. There are various ways to write an interpreted environment including a GUI based toolkit, an ANSI Common Lisp-based scripting environment, a JavaScript virtual machine implementation, a C/C++-based native OS kernel (often referred to as \"bytecode\"), and a more general purpose virtualization technology known as OpenVZ (a component-oriented framework). A similar approach was taken by the Unix shell family who provided a unified interface for running applications and scripts within a UNIX operating system.

            "The main differences between static-typed languages, dynamic-typescripting languages (also known as Typescript) and pre/procedurally typed programming are the types used by the programmer instead of object properties. Static typing essentially means that when you type something into an application or website, the system knows it is always going to behave identically even if different parts may change their output based on runtime conditions so long as those conditions aren't changed from code. In contrast, once some function has been defined for its inputs then those input functions will be applied automatically whenever it comes around (this is called auto-typing). This makes it easier for the developer to write simple logic without having to worry about whether statements might not compile due to syntax error later during compilation time. Because this isn't possible for non-static approaches where the compiler needs to know what values each variable has at every point (which would require more advanced knowledge), all programming paradigms work well on this kind of approach using statically checked data structures or arrays. Dynamic typicng typically involves adding new features via additions to regular programming languages which involve defining new objects, events or collections before they can be utilized and written back into an existing set (or being passed off to other objects created during development of previous functionality)<|endoftext|>",

The term was originally used by Apple for its QuickTime video playback system; it's also quite commonly heard today when talking about something in Python, for instance. Static instantiations allow you to construct programs at run time (e.g. create a new UI component).

For example Java uses an \"old\" dynamic type system while Python doesn't; JavaScript relies on ES6's functional programming model and OOP concepts rather than classes and interfaces - this isn't particularly surprising considering the number of programmers using both, especially compared to C/C++. In addition to this you'll probably want some kind of library management so your code can work with existing versions rather than rewriting from scratch, etc., and maybe even consider adopting something similar to Scala / Clojure or Kotlin where it will give better support and integration for existing tools without forcing people onto new technology (this has been tried out quite extensively with Python)<|endoftext|>"

You'll need basic knowledge of assembly code or C programming (C means \"command line\" so this will take some time), along with some understanding of maths and logic concepts such as data types and pointers. A good starting point would be by looking at some simple examples that use those concepts, which may also include writing code that does something similar - just look at [this example](_URL_0_) on an interactive prompt; it uses functions from `math` and `main()`, both of which we've already covered earlier. Asking questions about coding languages might lead to better answers than simply trying them out yourself.

You'd be able to type 'Hello World' in C++, without having to write any new statements or expressions yourself - because all the compiler would know at compile time was that what it was supposed to do is say Hello World. The idea behind static types comes from programming languages such as Java where every object has its own set of variables so each piece of code only needs to access one variable (the same concept applies here) instead of needing to define a whole class for every possible value. Static typing allows you to avoid this overhead since when compiling the compiler knows exactly what the result should look like even before you're writing any actual code!<|endoftext|>"

It makes the programming process easier for developers that are new at coding since they aren't required to think much about types. This also means that static languages allow more freedom than dynamic ones so programmers can write better programs without having to worry if their code has any errors due to typos or bad design decisions. Dynamic typing allows users to use different kinds of values depending on where they're used such as variables versus functions and arrays compared to lists which are always references. Compiled languages require extra steps between compiling the source file(s), running them through compiler and then executing the resulting bytecode.

Interpreting programs involves parsing them using machine-level tools called interpreters, which run at runtime after the executable file has executed.

            "Psychoanalysis is about how humans interpret themselves to others by observing behaviour\nand thoughts, which we call 'World View'.\n \nIn traditional western philosophy it can be argued that only when people observe other people's behaviours will they understand their position more clearly; because seeing as everyone else observes you see there must be reasons for them doing this -  this has now become known as *social* psychology, or social observation. It would then make sense if they were all reacting similarly (i.e. behaving according to the dictates of societal expectations), but with different motivations. To take two examples: your parents say that playing along at home will improve their relationship - thus making them appear more friendly! They probably expect some positive benefits and so choose not to do something differently. By contrast, most people play hardball because they want an argument - and thus are likely to pick on someone who does the same thing instead, and escalate rather than give up quietly. These kinds of differences explain why many groups prefer not being told what to do while those with power tend to get very annoyed with each other regardless of whether things are going well. So I think society expects you guys not to mess around much unless forced (forcibly). The result is that you're constantly telling everybody what to do since nobody likes being bossy and you don't like getting yelled at either, but your friends have no interest in understanding you even though that could lead eventually to violence...<|endoftext|>",

From here they spread into Asia Minor until they were banned there due to the persecution during the reigns of Justinian II & Constantine XI. \n\nBy Theodora Metivier's [book](_URL_0_) she covers this period of time with great detail including events such as the birth of Jesus Christ; Heiligengeist (\"Holy Ghost\") meaning Holy Spirit or God given power; Herodias' attempt at converting them to Roman religion; the destruction of Jerusalem's Temple which allowed their conversion to Judaism.

I've seen a few posts already claiming their holiday was named after Jesus Christ who reportedly lived during the last decade of Roman Empire; if that were true [it wouldn't make you laugh.](_URL_0_) This idea seems highly problematic when considering both Christianity's popularity among people worldwide and Christianity's relative isolation on Earth compared to other faiths, which leads us immediately to the question: how could an event whose origins stretch across continents and oceans suddenly become popular throughout Asia too? That might sound weird... well maybe not... [But apparently you're thinking that Christianity began spreading through Europe rather quickly--so there aren't too many reasons why Christians would try such crazy nonsense](_URL_1_); it simply doesn't feel right somehow! So let me explain. First things first -- why don't we use the Romans' language over here? It takes time to teach new languages fluently, especially for nonbelievers. Anyway, while Greeks didn't really start using Latin until 500 BC, by AD 300 or so, Greek was spoken into Hellenization---that is essentially learning everything we know today via reading ancient texts and oral transmissions instead of listening to professors lecture in Latin classes. When you combine Classical Greece"

This time may also see other religious ceremonies being performed on certain days. Some religions even go further back into pagan times, going all the way up through Greek religion before becoming Christianity itself  in Rome, as far back as early 6th century AD! I think its an interesting historical topic worth knowing!\n\nSeptember: St Patrick comes from Ireland. His arrival signifies that God has chosen another nation for His church. There isn't anything specific related to September in Judaism nor Christian culture generally. \nOctober : Halloween / All Saints' Day ; November 5th / Thanksgiving Day\n\n > December 31st is also considered [as 'Halloween'.] However the celebration does not involve costumes and parties etc.\n\nDecember 31st doesn't usually coincide with Christmas in any case. Most Christians would say the holiday began as a way of honoring Jesus who had been born after he died. Nowadays though, the term \"Christmas\" has become a bit meaningless and simply means gift giving or something special between friends/relatives which no longer implies \"celebrating the birth\". \n\n & #x200B;\n\nSo technically December is now considered part of \"All Saints\", which coincides perfectly well with both July 4th (a US tradition started centuries ago ) and August 25th, since both of these events fall outside of normal Orthodox calendar dates so long as your year doesn't run off to January.

It was not long after his death however that it became an important day to celebrate as Christianity had been spread through many lands during the Middle Ages.\n\nIn China, the Spring Festival (the Chinese equivalent of Christmas) has always marked significant events for the country such as its national celebration of Confucius, who lived over 2 centuries before becoming Emperor Qin Shi Huang. In Japan, Shinto celebrates its patron goddess Amaterasu, who symbolized the sun and lightening, while Buddhism celebrates Buddha as their protector deity.\n\nThe Jewish festival Yom Kippur occurs at least twice every year, once when the High Holidays begin and again just before Rosh Hashanah. Both times mark major religious ceremonies where Jews fast for nine days until the beginning of the new year and pray for forgiveness and redemption from God.\n\nIn India, Hinduism celebrates the birth of Vishnu as well as other gods including Ganesha, Brahma, Durga, Sita, Krishna, etc., but unlike the others they don't have specific dates associated with them.

It has been observed since at least Roman times as an important religious festival; there was even a pagan version called Saturnalia which lasted until January 6th. The origins of this tradition date back to ancient Rome itself: according to Plutarch, \"the Romans celebrate their festivals with great pomp\" (*De Nuptiis*, 1). \n\nChristmas Eve is another popular holiday in many places, but its origin dates back much further than Christianity. In fact, it goes all the way back to prehistoric times when people would gather together to eat food prepared by other tribesmen or women who had gathered earlier. This practice continued into modern times through various forms such as *f\u00eates de No\u00ebl* (\"Noel Fairs\") where groups of families come together over the course of several days to exchange gifts and have fun. These fetes were originally held during winter months so they could be enjoyed without having to travel far away from home. They eventually became very popular throughout Europe and North America, especially after the invention of refrigeration in 1776. Today, Christmas Eve is still considered a major event in many European cities, while New Year's Eve is often seen as a less significant affair because it doesn't involve spending money like you might if you're celebrating a big birthday party.<|endoftext|>"

It would therefore make sense that the same rules apply to humans being outside our bodies/intestines...<|endoftext|>",
            "Well, if you have some time and money then there's [a pretty interesting series of articles in Wired Magazine](_URL_0_) called \"How Do We Live Inside Machines?\" that is about as far from \"the way it seems\" goes.\n\nIn fact they talk extensively at length on why we're all trapped in this place where we exist (at least most people) within a system: \n\nThe short version for your question though... If our brain is built with these two systems and how well those interact, would there be any chance of living outside? Nope. Not really even remotely. That was basically what they found when doing research into artificial life and human consciousness -- just imagine having a body-sized computer that runs out of gas and explodes every couple days! There'd also likely not be enough food or water to support anything beyond a very small colony without a massive external supply chain and no other technology to make use of such things as solar panels. It'd be hard work maintaining the infrastructure alone and you probably wouldn't get off *just* because your cells don't last forever after a while, which makes it almost impossible to do so many things efficiently anymore - everything else will break down faster than ever before unless we start reusing them over again somehow instead of building more completely new ones from scratch each year like now. You'll see that as an extreme example here, but I'm sure similar arguments apply across much wider spectrums. And obviously this is only one tiny facet of our whole complex universe right here and now - plenty more ways exist by design or necessity, maybe not yet understood entirely by science itself yet, and none of them involve living humans anywhere near being able to sustain themselves.<|endoftext|>"

In this context, we talk about things like strings and loops; objects that exist in spacetime with their own internal dynamics and behavior. When it comes to black holes (the \"stuff\" of the big bang), a similar situation occurs: quantum effects cause certain energy levels inside a hole to get stretched out, while at the same time creating some level of mass for itself by increasing gravitational force over and above what's normal. So as far as string theories are concerned, all matter must have quantum mechanical properties -- not just the graviton. Theories involving massive particles called quarks do involve both forces being described in terms of particles which carry no charge, so there should be a difference between how these behave in a strong field or massless case, but nothing fundamental happens here! \n\nNow you're thinking...quantum fields aren't even *defined* in QFT! How can they make such abstract concepts from physical laws? That seems pretty bizarre when one looks closer. To begin with, we know quite well how QM describes reality; in particular, everything we measure is either perfectly consistent within the framework of GR (so if your friend asks why gravity is weak-strong depending upon his/her choice of frame of reference - and indeed, there really isn't any question whether space has an underlying curvature or not!) or exactly conforming to Einsteinian special relativity ([and hence to general relativity](_URL_0_)). What's going wrong? There seem to be two ways I've seen proposed for making QFT into something real: either use \"fermionic operators\", where a fermionic particle is a kind of bound state between bosons (as suggested e.g., in [this picture](_URL_1_) ), or define the quanta using an extra \"dimension,\" namely an additional index whose meaning changes from particle to anti-particle and back again.

In fact, his work was one of many attempts to find a consistent formulation of quantum gravity within the Standard Model of particle physics.

The two effects cancel out to give them zero net force; however, if you try to move one away from another, it will pull them together. This effect was first discovered experimentally with the [Hawking radiation](_URL_0_) - when light passes through a black hole, its wavelength changes as it does so. In GR, there's no such thing as \"light\" or \"heat\", only photons. So what happens? Well, we know that for any given photon, its frequency depends on where it came from. If I send a photon at some point A, then it'll come back at B, because the distance between those points is smaller than the radius of curvature of spacetime around me. But if I sent it at C, it'd still get reflected off my body and end up coming back at D. That means that the frequency of the photon must change depending on where it comes from! And since all frequencies depend on time, this means that the speed of light also varies according to time.\n\nThis is called *time dilation*, and it explains why clocks run slower after passing through a black hole.<|endoftext|>"

It might involve several factions fighting amongst themselves over resources and territories. In addition, you should keep in mind that history repeats itself, so even though you're writing a sci-fi tale set in modern times, certain events from previous years' histories could come back into play. \nThe key point here, however, is that you must provide enough detail within the text to allow readers to imagine various scenarios without having to resort too much to speculation and conjecture.

This means that there *is* no physical force acting on anything (at least not at very high energies).\n\nHowever, this doesn't mean that things aren't affected by gravity as we experience them. If our universe was empty but black-hole sized, then we would feel gravity like any other external force. The problem with this scenario is that if spacetime were flat, this wouldn't be true anymore. So physicists started thinking about how these effects could get \"stretched\" into what appear as curved spaces or time warps. In fact, one such result is known as [the curvature singularity](_URL_0_) - a point where everything inside gets stretched so much as to look unreachable. As far as I know, nobody has managed to prove beyond doubt that this actually happens when we really start talking about extreme fields; maybe some people will try. But the general consensus is that space and time become increasingly fine tuned after each new energy state reaches its final form.<|endoftext|>",
            "The law states that \"in a region where there exists an attractive gravitational field, the force due to this attraction will be greater than the combined effect of gravity itself (and therefore, if we consider only forces of interaction, the total force acting on any given particle in such a region would also exceed the combined effects).\"\n\nThis means that even though you can't see it directly as in some form or other, under certain conditions your local electromagnetic fields are attracting nearby particles. This is just one example: all sorts of things have been shown [here](_URL_0_) through various experiments with cosmic rays which interact electromagnetically with their surroundings by using magnetic deflection or electric repulsion. These are called charged particles. It turns out they're attracted because they move away from eachother but these motions themselves cannot attract anything else around them - hence they remain at rest relative to whatever object happens to cause them to be attracted.<|endoftext|>"

We could write down exact formulas describing how such phenomena interact with our universe based on all sorts of equations about relativistic gravity being \u201cquantized\u201d in general relativity but completely ignoring special relativity right up until the last second because every theory of physics knows precisely where the weak equivalence principle ends and fundamental forces begin and also tells us exactly why photons don't need anything more exotic to exist than a massless vector boson or Higgs bosons; light moves extremely slow relative to the size of atoms/molecules in our entire Universe...so while you might find the answer to your question quite satisfying, Einstein himself doesn't think the answers should matter to anyone today.<|endoftext|>",

            "In both cases, it depends on whether or not there was an object at one time which has mass but doesn't interact with any other objects. It would still apply if a gravitational force existed (though it could change from a \"normal\" acceleration due to gravity) as well as when we use general relativity instead of special relativity because it turns out that some theories don't agree about what kind of field effects cause space-time curvature and thus affect the equations used in general relativity. In either case, all laws are affected by interactions within spacetime. This can be thought of like trying to predict the future based only upon present events - this requires the idea that spacetime will evolve through a succession of states until nothing new happens and then you start looking forward again, rather than starting back after observing past things. So if two observers each have a copy of everything happening around them and their own universe looks flat and isotropic relative to those others, they might come up with completely different pictures later: maybe a bit more dense here; perhaps slightly faster down below the horizon, slower closer away above; possibly larger, denser structures just over here now. Or no such changes since everyone sees their view being pretty much the same except they were seeing the thing *from* their viewpoint. But in any case, our best predictions involve lots of very subtle stuff involving energy conditions.\n\nIf something else intervenes while I'm writing, let me know and I'll add details<|endoftext|>",

            "Coulomb\u2019s law (the Coulomb force) says that, if two charged particles repel each other by an amount greater than 1/r^(2), then they will continue to do so. If we look at it in a very simple way:\n\nThe electrostatic field has its origin from charge separation - this means electrons don't feel anything directly, but only their surrounding fields; you can think about them as little tiny electric charges around us with respect to which we experience our world as being like one big homogeneous conductor, because when those same charges meet, the total charge becomes equal to zero, thus causing the electric potential on both sides vanish. \n\nThis idea comes up quite often during science discussions where people use things like \"electrostatic repulsion\" or similar words instead of just saying that charges attract, because they want to say something more complex such as \u201ccharge conservation\u201d rather than just using \u201celectromagnetism\u201d. This also explains why many modern physicists seem to have difficulty accepting Maxwell\u2019s equations \u2013 it was already proven in the 18th century that electromagnetic waves exist even without having any direct relation to electrification, hence making all the above claims incorrect.<|endoftext|>",
            "It depends on what you mean by \"similarity\".  Coulomb's law can be viewed as a sort of analog to gravitational field theory.\n\nIn classical mechanics, Coulomb's force between two charged particles was determined from Newtonian principles; this applies in gravity too: charges attract one another through an electrostatic potential. This works well if both particles have charge - which it often does. If not then the particle separation must cause some other interaction such that there isn't just repulsion but attraction. The key thing here is that there needs to exist some minimum distance (in general relativity, at least) beyond which neither will fall toward each other because they're being attracted by their own masses and therefore don't need any external forces.\n\nIf we assume no-relativistic effects, the minimum separation needed increases with the mass of the objects involved so the repulsive nature doesn't disappear completely, even though there is now an attractive force. It would seem reasonable that something like [the cosmological constant](_URL_0_) might do this as well, since it appears to affect things via quantum fluctuations when large enough. But it really has nothing whatsoever to do with electromagnetism or the weak nuclear force.<|endoftext|>"

This is called electrostatics, or electrostatic attraction. The same thing happens when you apply a force on something, which causes it to move away from its source. In order for gravity to cause these things to happen there would have been a force acting on all particles at any given time, so we call this *gravitational force*. However, because mass has different properties than charge does, we also need to consider how gravitational fields behave under certain conditions, such as outside of a massive body. \n\nThis leads us to our next point: If you're interested in general relativity I recommend [this lecture by Prof Gero F\u00f6rster](_URL_0_) where he explains the idea behind Einstein's theory of special relativistic gravity using electromagnetism and quantum mechanics.<|endoftext|>"

The big one is [Big.AI](_URL_0_) currently has around 50m users, but if that figure gets any higher than that then perhaps even larger applications will begin to break down - at which point their usefulness may well stop being necessary!

The main difference is there will be no human intervention required when you use these technologies--it does all the thinking for you. Of course, using technology as an instrument might lead to unintended consequences if they're applied too widely across society; we want people who don't do drugs in cars to not get caught in front of the cops anyway!\n  * A better method would be looking directly into ethical issues involved with algorithmic decisions made based upon big data sources such as social media and geolocation. There\u2019s nothing wrong with allowing your algorithms make \u201cgood\u201d choices where applicable because everyone wins from improving our lives (this isn't inherently true, but some of Google's recent data mining practices give them a good excuse), particularly if said company makes money out of selling user information. \n   It was recently suggested that rather than giving the US president sole power over artificial intelligence, Congress should delegate this task, although its practical impact is debatable since the Constitution only assigns power and duties among federal heads of state and government, so states really aren't under any real obligation here given how powerful their legislative bodies already are. \n    Beyond that, a common sense approach towards the matter wouldn't involve banning certain types of questions before asking anything further: one example is whether machine language code written by humans looks exactly like other handwritten code.

The key thing here is understanding that while \"speed\" may mean more or less how quickly something happens compared with a traditional linear model of physics and mathematics, this isn't what determines performance in real-world situations. In reality there are several things that influence both time (the rate by which a given task must progress) as well as physical forces (which determine acceleration), such as friction and drag between moving parts of any sort; but ultimately it's about achieving maximum potential within constraints imposed by these other factors:\n\nSpeed: It should not exceed a set value regardless of whatever other circumstances may be involved in play (this can also depend on player choice). \nForce/Acceleration: Any movement of any kind has force behind it so when attempting to reach higher speeds, either because players want them or just happenstance will dictate the path of movement and its effects (if it takes too long for gravity to have any effect). If possible it is important to consider only using a minimum amount of power whenever feasible and if you use all your energy in the most efficient manner, even without needing extra energy beyond the cost associated with motion, then this matters very much - you don't necessarily need *extra* effort, you merely need greater than average efficiency, especially under some kinds of circumstances where a minimal action does provide benefits above simply having one's head held high enough for people around them to know better (think the 'invisible wall' defense mechanism employed during training).\nMass/Momentum: As noted above it plays a significant role, since anything can exert mass, momentum and/or velocity (for example objects pushing eachother down can accelerate due to gravity being attractive) they contribute directly into play through the combination of those properties, however generally we think about the situation where we're talking purely mechanical movements involving nothing else going on in addition to their presence; but this still impacts overall efficiency though by",
            "It is recommended that all speedrunners take this approach and not rely on just a few simple rules, which would lead to very predictable strategies.  You need some knowledge of the basic mechanics and what they are trying to achieve with each stage, along with a plan for how your own style should change in order to make them work well together as part of a larger team or an entire run (in-game terms: \"run\" is really two things: strategy + movement).\n\nI suggest following the below instructions for creating an average runner from 1 player - 5 players mode by setting up one specific group and making it into an online match; there will be different challenges throughout but also variations on what needs to happen within a single stage (like getting across an open space where only 2/3 have weapons, moving towards an enemy while the rest don't even get near him... etc.).\n\n    1. Create groups for both yourself and any other members who may wish to join the running process later during setup time, using either chat commands like \"joining\" (as soon as everyone gets here) or a scripting system if necessary (using \"/start run <command>\" after entering chat or typing \"/playmode <player id> /setteam [list]\"). You'll likely want several sets so multiple people can start their runs in different groups simultaneously, allowing everyone's play styles to be considered before anyone goes into action against enemies and obstacles (the most common problem is finding the best spot on a flat area where everybody starts at once -- so let the map know beforehand!). Make sure no player is blocked behind a wall because they could lose themselves and thus be outnumbered easily (it might actually cause problems down the line if they were blocking the entrance when another was about to go in first...)\n\n\n     2. If needed create special groups based off certain characters, abilities, classes, and builds to try to make matches easier through better use of equipment or more complex plans, especially when"

            "Speedrunners have a very different set of strategies and goals when playing Minecraft. There are no'standard' methods, there is only one way that everyone plays - and it's really fun!\n\nI can tell you some basic tips for speedrunning:\n1) Do not rely on your mouse alone as much (and be mindful about clicking with two hands). It's fine if you click twice in succession while holding down Shift/Alt key, but try using your right hand or something else instead. You will probably need to switch between both sides pretty quickly, so make sure you don't miss anything important by pressing shift after every click. Also consider moving around from block to block; you may want to get up into trees first then go back to the ground once you're safe enough. This gives you more time to do things like jumping over enemies before they attack you, which means you'll take longer to beat them. \n\n2) Be careful when getting behind cover - use a wall rather than just sitting still until someone attacks you. When people move past a spot where their movement slows down, wait for an opportunity to rush through it without being noticed. Don't waste precious seconds waiting around because your enemy could see you were coming anyway. \n\n3) Make use of skills - many skills offer extra ways to react to events. Try throwing items out of your inventory and using those instead of hitting the \"back\" button to re-enter your inventory. If possible, throw a bomb at monsters, otherwise jump straight forward. Other options include picking up objects nearby, smashing mobs, grabbing treasure chests, etc. These techniques aren't perfect solutions per se, but they provide lots of opportunities for fast reactions and skillful execution.<|endoftext|>",
            "Well, it's really not that hard. There are a few ways to go about this:\n\n* Try different play styles (ie fast/slow). If you find one where you get much better results than usual and feel comfortable playing more often then switch over for some of those other modes or try new ones altogether. The first thing I'd recommend is learning how to do quick button presses without moving your hands too quickly because that will cause errors in your movements and can lead to problems if you don't pay attention to what you're doing when using certain techniques. \n\nYou might also want to practice against an AI so you'll have some sort of experience with things like movement control as well as basic physics such as gravity.<|endoftext|>"

Rudi](_URL_0_) in 1922, using radio waves as a probe into cosmic rays.\n\nAt this point, he had already figured out that there were two fundamental constants: The \"fundamental mass scale\" (which determines the strength of interactions between particles) and another called the [fine mass scale](_URL_1_). They are related via the Planck length = sqrt[2*pi^(3)/G^4]*lambda_* where lambda_* is the ratio of the fine and gravitational scales respectively. At some particular value of G these two constants are equal to each other.\n\nSo what's going on here? Well, we have an experimental limit for gravity; we can't measure any distance smaller than 1/sqrt(10^-20) meters or so because that would violate relativity, which makes the fine and mass scales non-physical. In quantum field theory they're just equivalent to Planck units except with opposite signs. So the physical limit is now about 1.7x10^-19 meters. This gives us roughly 4.5x1019 seconds of travel time at c = 299792458 m / sec. It seems reasonable enough.\n\n & #x200B;\n\nFor reference, if you want to get more details on all of physics involved let me know.<|endoftext|>",
            "The fine-structure constant (i.e.,\u00a0the ratio of mass and charge) describes a fundamental physical property: its relationship with the speed of light, or equivalently, the energy per unit time at which waves can travel through space.  Since this concept was developed in quantum field theory, we have been able to use it as an approximation method for calculating some properties that are actually hard to calculate exactly such as the gravitational force on massive bodies, but also various other things like neutrino oscillations.\n\nThe \"fine\" part refers to being a good description of what's going on at short distances; one way to think about the fine structure constant is that if you had a bunch of particles moving very fast relative to each other -- say 1% the speed of light from our perspective -- then they'd all be having identical wavelengths.  If you were taking particle samples and trying to determine their energies by measuring them against some reference sample, there would be no difference between any two different energy levels since everything has the same wavelength.\n\nBut imagine you wanted to measure something really small -- maybe just the length of a single atom, so you could only measure the distance over which atoms move across your detector, not the overall movement of those atoms around the entire volume of your detector.  Now let's do three experiments!  Each experiment measures the average position change along a line connecting points A and B at times t1 and t2.  There will almost certainly be differences in these measurements depending upon whether you go into the center of the atom or the side away from the center, etc. However, because both sets of data correspond to the exact same state of motion (there might even be fluctuations due to statistical uncertainty), the error bars should come out roughly equal throughout the whole set.  For example, when comparing two positions measured with the left hand and right arm of the atom's frame of reference, the total number of counts registered in your system gives us information regarding the actual mean value"

You then use the conservation laws that tell us that any process will lead back into the source particle at some finite distance.\n\nSo your question really comes down to what type of theories do we want here - for example in [Quantum Mechanics](_URL_0_) one deals mostly with waves called quanta, which are massless excitations around the position and momentum vectors associated to classical waveforms; the conservation law tells you there's nothing stopping these as they move along a curve (like the surface of water), but there might be problems due to quantization. There were several different kinds of attempts over many decades by physicists who tried various types of quantum mechanics until people got stuck on trying to get all their calculations done simultaneously, while not giving up the hope that somehow physics could evolve through multiple dimensions beyond the 3d level of understanding...\n\nAs long as those constraints aren't violated anyway by some sort of hypothetical measurement/reconstruction mechanism (e.g., via relativity), most models still don't violate them even after thousands upon thousands of years. It was just hard because when it came out later it would've been difficult for people to see what went wrong before the solution arrived, whereas now everybody has computers and access to better experiments to study.\n\nThat said, if there was such a thing as an *ultimate* theory without the caveats mentioned above (such as time-translation invariance, locality etc.) I wouldn't have much confidence that our present day physical universe had started life exactly like the big bang scenario did (although the big bang happened shortly thereafter and the cosmological redshift made sure we saw that the big bang must happen somewhere close to our current age, and since that'd give you time traveler causality and",
            "The limit on what \"light\" can travel depends heavily upon what we're talking about. In everyday language, when you talk about an electron or positron as having mass, this has no practical consequence unless something changes its state from being a proton or antiproton to another. If we consider all matter (which includes photons) with masses less than the [electron's rest mass](_URL_0_) at 0*c*^2*, then electrons have exactly *1/r*^*2* while photons only interact gravitationally with gravity due to their relativistic effects - that's why they exist! \n\nWhen considering just ordinary objects in our universe such as protons, neutrons and quarks which have nonzero charges but very low energies compared to anything around us, then yes there are other effects related to electromagnetic fields. For instance: for particles moving along magnetic lines in spacetime called Electromagnets ([magnetized electric charge distribution](_URL_1_) is similar), then there are special cases where those magnetized field configurations can induce charged states of some fermions in different places (or equivalently different kinds of neutral fermions). And since massless neutrinos are part of leptons too (neutrinos carrying up-down quantum numbers and hence spin = 1), there is always an odd number of fermion flavors associated with them depending upon the way the lepton number was assigned in Nature; e.g., the muon flavor must be opposite the one used by neutrinos if there are 3 down quark families involved (since neutrinos were initially considered separately as massive particle). \n\nThere may also still be problems concerning gravitational interaction between particles. A classical result known as Pauli Exclusion Principle states that there should not be any two particles of same kind closer together than certain maximum value c\\*l=3G/c^2**, although even that condition might become irrelevant as energy levels increase (this isn't actually so easy though...for example see here : _URL_2_; in fact most physicists nowadays prefer"

Gauss.[1]\nIt relates to a phenomenon called \"Rayleigh scattering,\" which describes the effect that light has on particles within an electromagnetic field; if you're familiar with classical electrodynamics then this should make sense. Rayleigh scattering occurs when there's something like electrons or ions flying around - they are just part of our everyday universe. When these particles scatter off another particle from some distance away, they do so much more quickly than the other particles can escape, since their wavelength isn't longer than the wavelength for the electron/ion pair to pass through each other before escaping again. The resulting photons have enough energy to be emitted into space without being absorbed back inside, meaning the photon stays very far away but not too long after passing out of your eye, causing you to see what appears to be blurry stars or planets even though it actually hasn't passed any closer than 10cm to your retina!\nSo, the basic idea behind all science involves relating two phenomena: radiation (the electromagnetic force) and interference between different frequencies (like how water absorbs visible light). As I said above, Rayleigh scattering happens when one frequency interacts with another while travelling at near-light speeds, which means we only ever encounter one thing constantly during every second. So let me ask you three questions about it... \n\nFirstly, why exactly does this affect light so drastically? We don't know yet because nobody really knows where Rayleigh scattering will eventually take us once we reach such extreme distances beyond our planet's orbit. It might turn out that no matter where you go outside our solar system, nothing gets scattered except atoms/molecules in outer space itself, although there could well still be random fluctuations caused by molecules existing at the edge of things instead of randomly distributed throughout them. That would explain why our sun seems brighter to us despite having less mass relative to its surface area than Earth. However",

If t was much less than the time required for the photon to reach the observer from infinity then the second term becomes negligible and the third would give zero contribution to F, leaving us at V/h where our result should apply without any modification because the factor h is always there in front of everything else.\n\nIn reality though we're going to deal only with accelerations smaller than v/4. So if we want to know how fast something is moving relative to us we need two things to make sure we don't end up getting too far off. First we have to find out whether it's moving slower or faster than v/4 since we are interested in velocities relative to ourselves. Secondly we have to take account of all the other forces affecting motion like gravity, pressure etc... We do this via the Lorentz transformation, which takes care of these issues. \n\nLet me explain why the first issue matters more than the second issue. Lets assume that we",
            "The value for *\u03b1* relates to what's called \"redshift.\"\nFor example, a photon at rest has an energy E. If we move that same photon by some small amount, say 10 cm/sec (a few meters per second), then its energy will change slightly. The new wavelength would have changed from 1.5 microns (the original) back to 0.1 micron. This means that when the distance between you was one meter, your photon had been traveling in the red direction for 2 minutes, but now travels only 100 nanometers away. That's about 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the length scale used by the experimenter to measure redshift.<|endoftext|>"

This means that for any two observers who are moving with velocities v1 and v2 relative to each other, their clocks will run slower than those of one another when measured in terms of the new reference frame. In particular, they will have different values of the proper time \u03c4', which implies that there exists some value of \u03b3 such that \u03b3 < 1 / 2\u03c0c\u03c4 '. \n\nThis result holds true even though the Lorentz transformation between inertial frames doesn't change the frequency or phase of electromagnetic waves; i.e., the same wave propagates through both frames equally well.<|endoftext|>"

This distance should always allow us to compute the size we are missing when applying the formula \"width^2  - height\" to that point on our curve where width * y cointinues toward height. That number will just equal how much leftover space there still needs to add before returning the desired new dimension which allows us to fit the final element into a relatively narrow shape without too many ugly lines. So let's pretend there isn't any gap between those two numbers because they look more like vertical edges than horizontal ones (if I understand correctly). We want 1 additional unit added inside each corner but since only one pixel has been made for our entire area we need the extra space to return back up to its proper dimensions instead of leaving out some space behind itself. There is less work here! For every unit created outside of your first step, apply a factorial multiplier onto the previous units to yield the correct amount for your initial shape. The factors multiply together based off of their base ratios, giving roughly 2*4*7*=14+16=42 as needed.

But I feel its importance cannot be understated because of this name and what happened there.\n\nIn fact, all people are going to talk about was one particular person - Hutu or Tutsi. And after those two groups got together against each other, they were both being killed by their own government while living at the same time on a small piece of land called Kigali (which actually became capital). The killing of Hutus started first with the president himself who then led the army into Kisangani to kill as many non-Hutus and also to clear them from any possibility of revenge. Then the killings grew even further when Habyarimana (the previous president) died suddenly during his visit home after having been ill for months; and finally he did die on October 1st 1994, but not before he had already sent out a telegram announcing the start of war between the government of Rwanda and the rebels, which later lead to another civil war where every single man went either way depending upon how they felt: For some it meant death and destruction while for others it meant freedom. \n\nBut these stories aren't really enough to describe exactly how things looked to most people around the world. Even though we might say 'It wasn\u2019t good' so you don't have to think that everyone lost everything except for you...you know. We should always remember something important here: People weren't aware yet what would happen next. That is why, if someone says anything negative towards the country itself, such as saying something mean toward the president or the parliamentarians, nobody takes notice. They usually focus only on themselves instead of thinking about how bad things could look now to anyone else. If somebody thinks differently, however, it means a lot of people are scared for example.

The country has been known for its great human development which is why this period saw some remarkable changes and progress. It had become one of Africa\u2019s most developed nations since independence when it faced massive economic problems due to the global financial crisis of 2007-2008.\n\nThe government of Rwanda was established by Hutu Power parties who were against Tutsi refugees. They formed their party with a very small support base within the society, so they needed people around them for leadership duties or other important matters related to politics, especially since many of these young men wanted to study science. After years of planning and preparation, the new regime managed to win elections on July 28th, 2015.\n\nIn April 2016, Rwandans celebrated Independence Day at the National Stadium, Kigali, in front of the world media. This celebration marked another step forward towards national unity because there was no doubt that this nation would be led by the leader of one political party \u2013 the United Democratic Party (UDP) headed by Paul Kagame. He started his reign as President in May 2018 with some controversial actions such as destroying monuments dedicated to victims during the civil war; sending military soldiers into eastern Congo without informing the UN peacekeeping force (UNAMIR); and building a border wall between South Sudan and Rwanda. \n\nThis past year also brought some changes within Rwanda\u2019s system of governance: the Supreme Court ordered Parliament to delay the impeachment process until next year and then passed laws banning demonstrations. In February 2019, the president resigned under pressure from opposition groups calling him ineffective, while he said he hoped to improve relations with neighboring countries like Burundi and Tanzania through better diplomatic ties. On October 22nd, 2019, the government announced plans to launch a $1 billion dollar gas pipeline to connect Uganda and Rwanda via Lake Nyos"

In his writings, William Shakespeare makes many references to a particular political group he identifies with (French Nationalists), who are against slavery. However, one could argue that there are many parallels between what Shakespeare writes in the play \u201cRichard II\u201d (\u201cShakespearian Richard 2\u201d) about King Edward IV's life before taking on power after Henry V\u2019s death. It has been suggested that these parallel ideas stem from English literature which also describes King Charles I as 'Charles of Anjou', and so we have the notion that King Edward should be considered the \"Great Prince\" in comparison with him being referred to only as \"Prince.\" \n\nHowever, while the two plays deal mainly with issues such as royalty vs non-royalty and politics in general they also make use of metaphorical words to express thoughts. One example is \u2018King Richard\u2019. While the name implies kingship and nobility at the same time it does not refer specifically to king Edward himself but rather the concept behind monarchies in general, and the importance placed upon the person holding authority over their people or state: \u201cI think all this [kingdom] depends entirely upon the crown.... For me alone if any man shall succeed him I am ready to swear my honourable life; though mine own life stand secure.\u201d So even in a sense you can see how Shakespeare employs metaphors in order to depict characters through various themes without making specific statements. \n\nAs well, there seems to be no shortage of instances where similar terms and phrases were used by writers within different periods during the 17th century - e.g., The Old Testament contains passages dealing with Jews as being untrustworthy or hypocrites because God made them so for some reason; \u201cGod forbid!\u201d etc\u2026 Even the idea of Jewish people becoming a minority and hence under the threat of destruction still existed.

This was one of several genocides against minority ethnic groups throughout Central Africa, beginning with the [Hutus' massacres of Tumbi sub-Saharan Africans](_URL_0_) in March 1991. During this time period, thousands were killed in a series of battles called the **genocide**. Many others died because they refused to surrender or be absorbed into their communities. One hundred thousand people are estimated to have perished during the conflict, including more than 10% who committed suicide due to starvation, illness, disease, exposure to the elements, rape, beatings, torture, execution, etc.\" (Nyagoda & Ojala 2001)\n\nThe aim of the Rwandan genocide was not only to exterminate the Tutsis but also other minorities such as Hmong, Chamois, Lozi, Swahili, Mende, Yoruba, Ibo, Kamba, Fula, Gukurahundi, Kayin, and Mandingo; however many lives were lost for political reasons and religious purposes as well. A major problem facing Rwandans at the end of the conflict was that it led to further ethnic divisions among various groups which would eventually lead to a state collapse in 1995, where some regions remained under government control while others broke away from the country. After a long process of national reconciliation following years of unrestrained violence and murderous rule by former regime leaders, a transitional period took place wherein most areas regained stability. In 2003, a peace agreement established between Rwanda and its neighbours led to significant changes across all sectors of society. However, despite these gains, Rwanda remains a highly unstable country with no real prospect of democratic governance, although there does exist limited popular support",

The country was founded on 18 July 1960 under the leadership of Paul Kagame and he was elected president by the National Assembly at the age of 25 years old. His government had to contend with many internal conflicts which resulted from ethnic tensions, political violence, economic instability and social unrest all contributing towards creating a nation where there were no more people left alive than before. He also managed to bring together some of his compatriots who fought for him against the Hutu-led regime while others fled into exile or died in the process of trying to get out.\nThe first major war between the two sides occurred when President Habyarimana took over after having served three terms since 1986 but it wasn't until 1996 that he finally succeeded. It's hard not to be impressed by this achievement as he did manage to keep up good relations with both the international community and neighbouring countries despite being one of Africa\u2019s poorest and most isolated states. This led him to establish a constitution in 1997 that established several rights such as freedom of expression and religion and equality among citizens, something that would become even stronger once the civil war ended (Konstam 2005).

            "The Rwandezi Genocide: A Study on the Rape in Africa Essay\n\nIntroduction\n\nRwanda\u2019s genocide, which was carried out by Hutu and Tutsi against a population of some 10 million people, occurred between July and December 1993. This period saw several massacres of civilians committed by both sides during what has been described as one of the most brutal periods in African history (Bosco 2009). The Rwanda genocide was also known for its ethnic divisions among different groups within the country. Although this may sound like something out of the ordinary, it did not happen without reason because many victims were killed at random while others died after being caught unprepared or under duress from their captors. In other words, although these crimes happened all over Rwanda, there are certain aspects that make them unique to this particular conflict.\nIn fact, there have never been such incidents since colonial times; thus why we refer to them now. As such, they should be studied with care when dealing with contemporary issues related to human rights violations and atrocities throughout the region. It is therefore important to look into how the genocides played out before coming up with conclusions regarding possible causes.\n\nA brief overview\n\nBefore going deeper into analysis and writing an academic paper using the Rwanda genocide, I would first want to provide a background information. The events surrounding the genocide took place around June-December 1993 where approximately 2 million citizens fled their homes in Rwanda due to civil unrest following the death of King Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana in February 1991. After his death, his government became increasingly authoritarian and oppressive towards the Hutus who had dominated politics until then. Many believed that the king had deliberately orchestrated the killings so he could take power away from him, but the truth remained elusive even though the army continued killing Hutu men in retaliation. However, it wasn\u2019t just those who wanted revenge for losing control"

This decision came after years of civil unrest following the death of President Juvenal Habyarimana who had been elected on a platform of reconciliation with the Tutsis.\n\nIn response to this crisis, the Hutus launched a campaign of terror known as Operation Truth or Dare (TNTD). In order to justify their actions, they claimed that the Tutsis were responsible for the deaths of thousands during the genocide. They also accused the Tutsis of being behind the assassination attempt on Juve Habyarimana. As a result, many people fled into exile from Rwanda.

            "This is a very good question. It's hard to answer, but one of my favorite things about history classes is learning when and why different people chose not to do something or fight for it - so if you're asking this, I think there are multiple reasons that might explain your question:\n\n* Early Virginia settlers had more reason than most to be concerned with slavery (as much as some people would like us to believe otherwise) because they saw slaves as less valuable than livestock; see [this](_URL_0_) article on how many African-Americans owned horses before the war and who was selling them at auction. And yet there were plenty of wealthy whites who didn't want their sons and daughters marrying into enslaved families, either out of fear or greed; by 1700 slave owners could buy nearly 2 million acres of land from freedmen. In fact, William Byrd, Sr., purchased over 9000 acres of tobacco plantations just after he sold his slaves off to private investors back in 1831, making him arguably the richest man in America up until then, worth an estimated $20m today. So even though Virginians thought all black men deserved freedom and citizenship regardless of wealth, the reality was far simpler than many white Americans believed - and that includes the ones we've been trying to ignore throughout our nation's long history! \n * The first significant wave of free blacks came between 1619 and 1830, including such famous figures as Robert Williams Jr., James Madison, George Washington, Paul Revere, John Dickinson, Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, Patrick Henry, Susan B Anthony, Frederick Douglass, Frederick Douglas, Charles Sumner, Wendell Phillips, David Walker, Marcus Garvey, Toussaint L'Ouverture, Daniel Webster, Benjamin Franklin, Samuel Adams, Alexander Hamilton, Aaron Burr, Richard Rushmore, Martin Van Buren, James Monroe, Woodrow Wilson, and Abraham Lincoln among others, each having a personal connection with",
            "The first point is that you need to distinguish between two different kinds of failure. The second one has more implications, but I'll do a quick summary here:\n\nIn theory, there was no real reason why it failed - if they'd had enough food and water they would have survived for weeks with nothing but disease. In practice, when things went wrong during their journey upriver, everything turned out fine. It's very hard to say what caused this particular disaster because we only really know about several aspects at once (e.g., ship-building) which makes pinpointing specific causes difficult too. \n\nOne possible cause could be something as simple as not having adequate supplies or equipment to survive on the long river trip; maybe they got caught in a storm or were just unlucky due to bad luck. There are also likely various factors like lack of experience from colonists who knew what to expect so they overestimated how much effort/money etc they needed to put into survival (it's very easy to underestimate such resources). Some people even argue that these people should get paid, since many died trying! This might explain some failures. But other theories include low morale among the men due to fear or frustration over failing so quickly after months without contact with native Americans.\n\nI've heard people talk about diseases being spread by mosquitoes around Cape Fear where most settlers lived, although those numbers aren't clear cut. That doesn't mean it can't happen, though.\n\nFor instance, [here](_URL_0_) is an interesting piece on disease control efforts against malaria across Virginia before Europeans arrived, which shows quite clearly that it wasn't entirely impossible for malaria to develop in areas close to settled populations.<|endoftext|>"

In particular:\n\n >  In order for colonization to work as an idea was it had to have economic success - meaning that they were able to sell food/drink locally. It would be like having all the settlers on your ship want you drink alcohol and only want local wine instead of going off course. The reason I'm sure is because many colonists came from wealthy or politically powerful families (which made sense when most of them owned their own businesses), which means if the company was losing money due to piracy etc., they might well decide \"We need better profitability here\". So maybe one could say they needed less government control but still got a good return out of owning property themselves... \n\n\nThat said, colonial governments tended to use resources inefficiently (the French took so long trying to settle America; while the British went looking after Virginia and other places more quickly). That doesn't mean people didn't do their best - by the end of 1704 the governor general was writing down plans with the hopes he'd find a place to live near Londonderry (or Halifax) and give them permission to buy land elsewhere within two years! And though these efforts were ultimately futile (because English taxes wouldn't kick-in until the mid 18th century and no man really wanted a permanent home just yet, despite promises), what's interesting about the situation in this era are the ideas being developed around private ownership over public land (not least since large numbers of the poorer class actually held onto lands belonging to their employers):\n\n_URL_0_\n\n\n > *I\u2019ve never heard such arguments before. A man will build a house for himself on his neighbor\u2019s field.* This view is quite prevalent today. \n >   The American farmer is supposed to know his neighbor intimately\u2014his crops yield him fruit twice every year and once",
            "This is a tricky one, as I know it has to do with politics. \n\nI will give you two different points of view that can explain why: first was political and second military success were more important than anything else (both politically). \n\n Political: There were multiple factors involved for failure.  The first thing we have to address when discussing failures during colonial rule are issues regarding control over the Indians at Jamestown; after being defeated by an American-led expedition there wasn't much room left on Virginia's side to maneuver or take care of their Indian problem once they'd conquered all those natives and moved them onto new land where there was little native opposition against English interests (it didn't help matters though, since some tribes were very friendly toward white colonists, who wanted no part of their influence and authority); however this led directly into conflict between British authorities who believed in continuing direct government under royal law (they thought if you tried something, everyone would come along and demand a similar arrangement), versus settlers' claims that Native Americans could only be ruled by someone appointed through royal consent/permission - not even legally elected like many European powers had been. \n\n\n The issue became clear from a simple survey conducted prior to colonization by Governor James White of Plymouth Colony (and he went down about 15% compared to the number taken in a typical survey before settlement): \n > Of persons residing upon this frontier in 1707...of 1st families 593 were women while the average man of each family was 31 years old...of such families 4 females and 6 males were children, leaving us without male offspring.\" This indicates how important sex ratio problems among natives actually turned out to be because \"children\" was the major group that made up nearly every indigenous community living in New England prior to colonialization; moreover men constituted roughly 70% of total native population whereas boys represented 20%. By comparison the adult rate among whites (whites averaged 55) also rose sharply throughout colonial timeframe. As [R"

            "This is a great question. It's difficult to give an answer that encompasses everything from military tactics and strategy, but here are some reasons I think might help:\n\n- The lack of coordination among different colonists at this point - not only were there many people involved with planning the expedition itself (such as William Smith), but they didn't all know each other well enough to be able to communicate effectively during their joint meetings on December 6th or 7th. There was no cohesive command structure within the Virginia Company.\n\n- The nature of colonial life means that men have very little time for themselves when they're away from home. Colonist George Goodenough had been absent for months while he built his house near Jamestown. His wife wrote him a letter asking what happened after her husband left them. He answered, \"I do not now understand why you should expect me to go about my business again until next Monday.\" When the captain came back around New Year's Day 1704, it would take three days before Goodenough could even send a reply by messenger because everyone else in town had gone off hunting and fishing. Even then, communication between members of the crew remained extremely difficult. In addition, Goodenough couldn't speak English so communicating instructions over a regular language wasn't really possible; therefore, it became increasingly necessary to use a written form of instruction whenever needed. This also meant more letters than usual going out -- probably too much to hope anyone would read through those without any response whatsoever.\n\n- At one point in late March/early April of 1699, Thomas Jefferson himself was in Philadelphia attempting to raise money for another venture which was later named after him -- Monticello, in Charlottesville. By June of 1700, John Rolfe had resigned from the company as acting governor of Virginia. One of the things he said that convinced others of the importance of maintaining discipline among the colony's officers was the fact that they had to maintain good order every",
            "It was a long, drawn out process of negotiation.  The Native Americans didn't have to be there for it all to go sour on them (or rather, they were more likely to come down with scurvy and then die anyway).\n\nYou might say that by leaving, they also left behind a bunch of cultural artifacts from their homeland: written language; burial grounds/mounds etc... That would help explain why people wouldn't just up and leave like most colonists would.<|endoftext|>"

            "There are several things I want to address here. First of all, it is a very difficult question for historians because we have no written record and little evidence as yet about what actually occurred during this period. The best way forward is probably by looking at other sources such as diaries from those who were there or letters from their contemporaries which may shed some light on the events that happened but they can't give us enough detail to be able to reconstruct an accurate history of how things really went down. \n\nThe second thing I would like to talk about is just why the colonists failed. It's important not to make too much out of one incident - if you look at it simply as \"colonist failure\" then it doesn't seem so bad. But when thinking back over time, especially with hindsight after reading up more than a decade later, it does become clear that many aspects of the expedition were flawed. For instance, the first part of the voyage was quite successful (the ships reached Virginia), and even though most of them had problems, the majority managed successfully through storms off Chesapeake Bay. However there wasn't any real attempt made at making contact until May 1587 when John White wrote his journal entry saying he'd heard the natives talking of trading goods for slaves. This was followed shortly thereafter by the arrival of another ship called HMS _Savage_ under Captain Thomas Dale. He set sail again two days before leaving and sailed into Jamestown harbour where he found out immediately that white men were living amongst the Native Americans! After a few weeks of trying to find a peaceful solution between these people, the English decided to send out a smaller party of soldiers to go around hunting down and killing all the Natives within reach. They didn't succeed in finding anyone else, and eventually they left without ever reaching land. In terms of logistics, this means that while they could certainly get supplies across the water, getting everything done took months due to lack of communication and transport",

            "Revolutionary Weapons, or what we know today as \"weapons of war\", have been around for centuries. From the time when muskets were invented until WWII, there was an arms race between countries to see who could make better and more accurate guns than others at any cost - whether it be money spent on research or simply bullets made from gunpowder, which would then go into cannon balls, shells, etc., these are all still being used even now.\n\nWe also have examples where revolutions happened because people had lost their fear of death (or lack thereof) due to religious beliefs, economic instability, political oppression, social change, and various other reasons why people believed that they must overthrow the old order or else perish (this is just one example). This has lead us down many different paths over history: the civil rights movement; communism in Russia and Eastern Europe, feminism, gays/lesbians in the US, anti-colonial movements like those against Spanish and Portuguese rule in Asia and Africa, and so forth. \n\nSo you can't say revolutionaries didn't exist before WW2 - but it's not exactly correct to think that only military matters were important. There will always be someone with a new idea, or another path forward after going through this process (and most times the ideas come from somewhere outside of your own country), though that doesn't mean everyone agrees!<|endoftext|>",
            "Revolutionary Warfare:\n - The concept of revolution is not limited to the American Revolution, but has extended across time and space throughout history. During the French Revolution, for example, people protested against the government's plan to reduce taxes on sugar and bread by forcing them out onto the streets; when Napoleon attempted this, he was defeated at Waterloo after many battles with overwhelming numbers from his enemies. In World Wars One and Two, it became more important than ever that military technology be used to fight effectively without being overpowered or lost before it could become critical in war. The idea of revolutions also applies to modern warfare as well, where there are movements that seek change and freedom among those who oppose their leaders' plans to take advantage of natural resources such as oil reserves, water supplies, metals, forests, etc., or exploit human rights violations like colonialism, slavery, apartheid, racism, sexism, environmental destruction, etc..  These revolutions can often bring large-scale social upheaval into countries whose governments have been unable to deal with these issues due to lack of control or corruption. \n - Examples of revolutionary arms range from firearms developed during the Spanish Civil War (1936) to advanced tanks created during WWII. <|endoftext|>"

            "-Revolutionary Warfare: Weapons and strategies for the First World War (by Thomas Coote, 1998) -\n\nWhile an absolute expert on WW1, these papers are quite dry on the details of battle tactics; they do detail the development of new weapon systems such as the \"shrapnel\" trench system as well as the use of mobile artillery units which had to be adapted during the war by armies around Europe from France through Belgium. A great example is one unit that served alongside infantry troops with considerable mobility. The men were very familiar with how enemy terrain was mapped, but this would have been useless without accurate observation. Some famous examples of this could also be mentioned if not given enough space -\n\n-Militaries equipped only with field artillery will generally take over targets by themselves, while light tanks can effectively destroy many armoured vehicles like Panzer IIIs at ranges approaching 1km(8 miles). When deployed along roads or railways, tank drivers often cannot stop their trucks sufficiently because either heavy traffic impedes them at high speeds or they see other cars coming towards them when entering intersections (a phenomenon known as \"spur jamming\") resulting in collisions and/or rollovers where motorcyclists collide with tanks in order to avoid it. This problem was lessened somewhat by using radio navigation, allowing the soldiers behind to follow the route directly home via air reconnaissance data collected from military radar stations. In all versions of German military aviation, however, tactical aircraft took most part of combat operations offensively since they relied entirely upon ground fire due to lack of fighter support against armored formations, especially after November 1918 though. \n\n-Technologies developed in the 1930's before the outbreak of WW2, including armour penetration and anti-tank missiles meant modern armoured fighting force need no longer rely solely on speed to fight the Allied Offensive Campaign of September 1944 onward. Armour thickness reduced greatly so even a relatively thick vehicle such as a Pant",
            "Great minds think alike!\nIn World War II, the Wehrmacht used two large arms factories called Daimler and Messerschmitt that supplied the Reichswehr with small arms ammunition; this was one of Germany's largest foreign aid projects prior to 1945.  These two companies formed part of Nazi state-owned German military company Einsatzstab Neudeu - or \"the NND\" (which is usually abbreviated as the NS for National Socialist.) The NSD also had many branches which were run by local units under civilian control from Munich in West Prussia until 1944, when the headquarters took over from these men and the other main branch continued its activities with little real change afterwards, moving back out of Berlin towards Radebeul/Rottenburg near Mainz where the headquarters eventually became known as Schloss Stahleckhaus, then a prison complex before being converted into several different camps housing thousands during WW2's final phase. \n\nThe first big issue you'll need to deal with is how to classify any equipment: after all if you are discussing items such as bombs it will be referred to as Boms (or Bomb) regardless of their source, whether they're bought overseas directly by an individual firm like those on the left at Ausgleichwerke or brought up in stores across the country where the supply chain runs from factory to shop. However more commonly, we hear about munitions going through various departments within the Weapons Division, especially what happened in 1938 right around the time Hitler got his nose broken when he ordered 3 billion lb WG 3 bomb production begun. This produced millions upon millions of small arms including most famously, Sturmgewehrs (a German version of grenades). Other smaller issues can come when asking about particular types of weapon such as guns vs rifles: why would Hitler want 2x K98s and 10mm pistols together? A better question might've been why do Nazis have so much fascination with guns"

            "Revolutionary arms are important because they can be used to defeat the enemy and bring victory over him, but it is not always possible for them to do so without losing their lives. The main reason why revolutionaries need such arms is when there will only be two sides fighting against each other: one side wants peace with the enemy while the other wants war with the enemy, and this means that neither of these groups has any real hope of winning if the situation does not get worse before it gets better.\n\nSo what kind of arms would you like to use? There were plenty of different kinds of guns during World War One (including tanks), but none was particularly revolutionary as far as we know. In addition, most people didn\u2019t really have enough ammunition or time to make much difference anyway - even at the end of the war, many soldiers had spent all their bullets and shells on just getting out alive.\n\nThe British Army did have quite an arsenal though. They certainly knew how to fight a battle, although they never managed to win it outright due to lack of resources and support from home government. However, after the Armistice in November 1918, Britain still possessed a large number of rifles, machineguns, and grenades which could be used by its troops. So yes, they did have something useful here. \n\nHowever, those who wanted to take advantage of the chaos following the Treaty of Versailles might also consider using firearms. After all, the German army had been reduced to a skeleton crew by 1919 thanks to a combination of poor planning and bad leadership, but the Germans were determined not to allow another world war once they won the first. As long as Germany retained control of Europe's largest economy and military power, no matter how great the damage was done to her own population, she intended to remain the dominant player in international politics until 1945.<|endoftext|>",
