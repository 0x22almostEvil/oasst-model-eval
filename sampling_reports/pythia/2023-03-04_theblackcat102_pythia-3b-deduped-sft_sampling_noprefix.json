As with any investment, it's always better to have more money available than less. To that end, some basic questions you should ask yourself are:\n\n* How much do you currently contribute? (This will help determine how large an employer match is likely to be.)\n* Do you need additional options like IRA rollovers or automatic contributions? If so, what size and frequency do you want them?\n* Are there other expenses such as child care costs which could impact this amount/frequency?\n* What type of returns would be ideal for you? Roth vs Traditional vs Simplified or Target Retirement account types all offer different return expectations depending on your individual risk tolerance level.\n\nOnce these factors are in place, researching each plan offers by your company should give you a clear picture of their features and benefits.

It can be hard or even impossible sometimes to collect sufficient data for building reliable language models due to factors such as budget limitations and availability. The ability to gather enough training examples could be critical to the success of the final model produced by these models because if you don't have adequate amounts of labeled text data your results may not look good when evaluated against human-created data. This problem doesn't really affect many people directly though because we use relatively cheap datasets like Google News Tweets for this task, so the impact isn't as much felt at large scale as compared to things like computer vision tasks where real images/video data would help improve accuracy on the trained system more significantly. \n\nThe other thing to consider is whether a specific goal is required - is there a certain kind of outcome being sought that the machine needs to produce to be considered useful or acceptable? For example, suppose that the only thing necessary to achieve some end point was just accurate information production: if an AI could simply give you all kinds of answers, without any error correction mechanism then you wouldn't feel too satisfied either way; it might just provide information faster than you need but no less accurately than before!<|endoftext|>"

You can already write functional code in a dynamically typed system like JavaScript or Python and it will still run correctly at runtime without explicit type declarations; this allows the compiler to optimize your programs further while allowing you to take advantage of new developments that may appear in some months from now, such as neural networks. This also makes debugging much easier since when bugs arise it's just necessary to make more tests (that compile slower but execute faster) on various points where there are buggy expressions until we know which ones trigger that error.\n\nTo finish let me point out that the most important goal today in programming isn't really optimization though, but rather scalability: to allow huge amounts data analysis algorithms to process enormous datasets within reasonable timespans with relatively little effort. In these terms, I believe JavaScript has plenty advantages over other popular languages: better interoperability with big frameworks such as React/Flux/Webflux/Vue.js, higher efficiency thanks to the use of libraries available throughout the ecosystem, support for multi-core architectures by default with asynchronous computations, better tooling integration with Visual Studio 2017 and so forth.

            "In The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald uses time to create a vivid and engaging story that is set against the backdrop of the Roaring Twenties. In his novel, Nick Carraway, who serves as narrator for much of the book, tells readers about his experience living in New York City during this period. He explains how he spent each day with his friends and family while attending college at Princeton University and how he enjoyed every minute of it until he left school in 1923.\n\nFitzgerald describes these years by using many different metaphors that represent time passing slowly or quickly, such as \u201cthe long ago,\u201d \u201cthe old days,\u201d \u201cback then\u201d and so on. Throughout the novel, readers are introduced to various characters from Gatsby\u2019s past who all share their own experiences and perspectives. They help tell the tale of Gatsby's life through stories of love, passion, tragedy, betrayal, ambition, hope, despair and redemption. These events and themes are interwoven throughout the narrative and add color and texture to the overall storyline.\n\nOverall, The Great Gatsby presents a unique look into one man\u2019s journey toward self-discovery, both personally and professionally, while also providing a rich and colorful tapestry of 1920s American culture. It provides an entertaining read that will appeal to fans of literature, history and classic fiction alike.\n\n<|endoftext|>",
            "Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a classic novel that tells the story of Jay Gatsby, who lives his life on top of money and power until he loses it all due to a car accident. Throughout the book, Fitzgerald uses many metaphors to describe the effects of time on different characters, especially Gatsby himself:\n\n1. \"It was like trying to pick up the pieces after a great blow.\" (4)\n2. \"I've never felt so much at one with anything as I did then...in love\" (17).\n3. \"You're still young enough to have your youth back again. The sun's shining out there somewhere. It won't be long before you can see it yourself\" (30-31).\n4. \"We are born for such moments....For the briefest moment we stand naked; And our hearts begin their beat alone; But the years go rolling on...And when we die We will lie together side by side\" (32-33).\n5. \"A thing of beauty is a joy forever; A thing of value is a treasure always; God put beauty into my soul That no other soul should tarnish or destroy.\" (35-36) <|endoftext|>"

            "The novel The Great Gatsby was a story that took place during a time where America had become very wealthy and everyone seemed to be happy. It also showed the effects of this wealth on society, with some people becoming rich quickly while others struggled to get by day after day. However despite all these problems, one thing was constant: the passage of time.\n\nIn the book there were many metaphors used to show how life went for those who did not have money and those who were lucky enough to make it. For example, Jay Gatsby would often talk about how he lived his life like someone is \"watching him\" as if they are watching their own lives play out before them from afar. This shows how fast things can happen when you're not careful or focused; everything seems fine at first but then something goes wrong and you realize what's important later.\n\nAnother common way characters spoke about their feelings was through the use of metaphors involving clocks, such as the quote from Nick Carraway which says, \"It's funny how time passes. When I look back, I'm surprised how long ago it was.\" In addition, F. Scott Fitzgerald himself wrote in his journal that he felt like the world around him was moving so slowly compared to how quick time actually flies for him (Fitzgerald, 2009).\n\nThis idea is further emphasized through the use of the word \"ghost\". Many times throughout the novel there would be scenes featuring people talking about ghosts and the idea of being haunted, even though no real evidence exists to support this theory. This is especially true because in the novel there were many different kinds of supernatural occurrences, including ghostly apparitions and spirits appearing in photographs, and other events that could easily be attributed to coincidence instead. \n\nOverall, the concept of passing time was prevalent in The Great Gatsby due to the fact that the characters constantly reminded each other of the past and worried about the future (Baz",

            "The Great Gatsby is a novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald, published in 1925 and set in New York City during the Roaring Twenties. The book follows Nick Carraway, who moves to New York from his native West Egg after being hired as a clerk at Jay Gatsby's lavish estate on Long Island.\n\nIn the novel, time plays a central role in many aspects of the plot: for example, it serves as a symbol of the fleeting nature of life and love; it also provides a means through which characters can measure their own progress or decline over the course of the narrative. In this way, the passage of time becomes a key element in the story, both as a source of tension between characters and as a reflection of the changing fortunes of those involved in the events that unfold around them.\n\nTime is often used in the novel in a metaphorical sense, with references made to its passing and renewal, as well as to the cyclical nature of human existence and the cycles of fortune and misfortune that shape our lives. These themes are explored throughout the text, providing a rich tapestry of imagery and ideas that resonate deeply within readers today.\n\n<|endoftext|>"

            "The accident happened on April 26, 1986. Nuclear reactors are very complex machines and their failure is not always easy to predict or prevent. It was a relatively isolated incident in the context of the Cold War as it wasn't immediately clear that there would be any adverse effects for other countries from this event.\n\nThere were two primary reactor cores involved - each containing about 3200 fuel assemblies (the main part of a fissionable device). The first core failed catastrophically due to design flaws with the control rods, which were designed to slow down power production by absorbing neutrons. This caused an increase in neutron flux to one of four levels above normal; some of these levels were sufficiently high that they could cause explosions inside the containment vessel. \n\nA second series of events took place within minutes:\n\n  * First, the cooling system shut off because of insufficient pressure - this also causes overheating and subsequent melting of the components around the pumps used to pump water into and out of the reactor. This led to an explosion when the cooling water became too hot to move through pipes connected to the reactor's outer shell.\n  * Second, a gas build-up occurred between the secondary circuit breakers and the electrical distribution network due to incorrect calculations regarding how much electricity was flowing into the grid. When this occurs, current can flow back into the primary circuit causing a fire to start if a spark jumps across enough wires. If this happens while the circuits have no load, then nothing will happen. However, once the electrical grids started sending power into the reactor compartment again, another spark could jump across just enough wire to complete the circuit resulting in an explosion. These problems had been known about since before construction began but had never really come up until now.<|endoftext|>",

            "Chernobyl is located in what's known as a *liquidator zone*, where all of the liquid fuel (which would otherwise have been dumped into rivers, and potentially washed out to sea) has long since been stored away from groundwater. This was due largely because there are very few safe storage locations available in such areas that were built after the first world war: basically it took an accident or two before someone noticed the danger here and got the place closed off - if they'd left it alone, there probably wouldn't be much evidence left by now anyway! \n\nIt was a small explosion that destroyed most of one reactor unit. It didn't take much damage;  one engineer said it looked like [this](_URL_1_) for instance, with a fire burning brightly near ground level on the top right hand side, while flames leapt higher up around its circumference, leaving behind glowing trails along its upper edges. However this isn't entirely true. In fact it appears the explosion was not enough to blow off the entire building: just enough debris to prevent its walls collapsing back down on itself so it doesn't collapse inward toward its center during subsequent seismic events, allowing more heat/energy to reach deeper levels. So while I suppose technically \"nuclear meltdown\" happened in the sense you describe above, we'll leave those sorts of descriptions to specialists in other fields, since that particular situation involved some rather specific nuances regarding both safety codes and geology.<|endoftext|>",

            "It's actually really easy to use a computer programming language as an extension to your normal typing and grammar skills - you don't have to be super tech-savvy to get started!\n\nFor Python:\n\n    Python has four main parts: modules (modules are collections of code), builtin functions (functions that are available in every module or subpackage) called keywords, standard library (everything not written by someone else which isn't covered by other packages like numpy or matplotlib), and global scope objects such as `dict` or `list`.\n\nTo write code in Python we'll need some basics first. There are three ways of creating a new variable name within Python; it can either start with a number (for example 1, 2, 3...) or any character (for example b = 'b') or two characters followed by another one (e.g. 'abcd' is also valid). This way of defining names allows us to easily reference variables across files/lines of code using underscores (_variable_name_) or dashes (-variable\\_name) but doesn't allow us to change them later on. The next important concept when learning about python is the dictionary, which acts kind of like a book where everything you want to know is stored neatly inside of itself. So now I've told you how to create new variables and dictionaries so let's do something interesting! \n\nThe first thing to learn is list comprehensions; this function will allow us to extract elements from our lists at specific indices into different places in memory without having to manually iterate through all the items in the list ourselves. It works very similarly to C++ for loop constructs but much faster and more efficient. You should be able to think of this like taking a list of words, say ['dog', 'cat'] and writing down their meanings, [x + y for x,y in zip(['dog','cat'], ['meow', 'woof'])] #Warning",

            "The basic syntax to use in Python is a combination of lowercase letters and digits (0-9) that represent various things such as numbers/decimals, words, punctuation symbols and special characters.

Class definitions start with class and end with :class:` < class name > `<|endoftext|>",
            "There are several different ways to write Python code depending on what you mean by \u201cfunction\u201d, \u201cclass\u201d, or other concepts that might appear as a variable (or function). Here are some examples:\n\n\n```python`print(x) #Warning: this example is experimental`\n```\nThis prints out `10`. Notice how there\u2019s no parentheses after `x` and it\u2019s not surrounded with braces like in many programming languages. The reason we need those extra things here? To make our intention clear! In Python, when writing a program, everything between the opening brace `{ }` and its closing parenthesis (`}`) is an expression. That means anything can be put into expressions; numbers, strings and even tuples. So if I wanted to use x as a number, I could just type `5` instead. This is also known as *variable declaration*. It's important to note that variables declared inside an expression must always have a value assigned. If they're unassigned then they'll become None. \n\nSo why does Python allow us to do all these weird things without having to wrap them up in brackets or parentheses? Why doesn't it force you to say 5 or print('hello')? Because Python allows any expression to act more or less exactly like another language would do so, but it gives you the freedom to define your own rules within the limits of its basic features.<|endoftext|>"

For instance:\n* In South Vietnam the Tet Offensive is credited with breaking up US troops' will and leading to massive American withdrawals (the North Vietnamese lost nearly 500 soldiers) and huge defections by those remaining in South Vietnam (Vietnam War casualty count reaches 7,000 dead.)

These developments all contributed towards defining a new era. On July 4th 1969 Neil Armstrong became the first man ever to walk on the moon and landed successfully just six hours later; meanwhile the Soviet Union put up satellites over Europe during their 'Star Wars' missile programme and America developed Sputnik 1 - a device capable of relaying data across millions of miles via radio waves at the speed of light. Apollo 11 also set a number of world records by reaching far higher orbits than had been reached before by any previous American astronauts.\n\nOne such notable historical date in the month of March occurred when two spacecraft entered Earth orbit together. Space shuttle Columbia splashed down off California on Feb 22nd and her counterpart, Atlantis, splashed down about 30 minutes earlier.  This landmark feat would become known as 'STS-1' and would mark the start of America's program of manned exploration into outer space. In total four manned missions flew in 1971, which was almost twice the number launched previously in 1966 alone!

Table [TABLE](_URL_2_) shows that pressure rises proportionally according to distance travelled away from any reference point along a given radius around any vessel, irrespective of curvature, or angle to its centre line (which will also determine direction). Thus if a given length or depth lies along a circle, we find the average value increases steadily as we travel radially outwards - although still remaining lower in magnitude compared with what might be measured near a single point (as illustrated graphically on p. 58, Figure 1b ).\n\n & #x200B;<|endoftext|>"

            "The expansion rate is directly proportional tothe temperature, but inversely proportionalto the density of the material. The higher the density, the lower the heat capacity and therefore the smaller the volume of steam that will be produced when heated above the critical temperature. For example, if the temperature were raised 100\u00b0C., about 20% less water would boil off than under normal conditions. In practice we can see this effect quite easily because of the large number of different materials which exist. When the density increases, for example, the specific volume of steam decreases; thus there are fewer molecules per unit mass. This means that more energy must go into heating up the liquid before it becomes saturated (at its boiling point) or reaches saturation temperature (when the liquid begins to turn to vapor). Therefore the amount of work required to produce a given quantity of steam increases dramatically with increasing density.<|endoftext|>"

You'll have no trouble finding somewhere quiet and peaceful to sit down with a good book or drink coffee. This place feels like you're entering another world completely separate from everyday life; just take one step inside and there's nothing else but the sights and sounds surrounding you. If you go during rush hour be sure to find an area where traffic isn't too bad and you can still enjoy yourself. \n\n2) Fez (also known as El Fes). A city unlike any other I've ever been to - beautiful architecture, fascinating history, incredible food and more than enough souks and markets to keep anyone busy all day long. Definitely make sure to try the couscous, kebabs and falafel here while you're visiting if they offer them! And don't forget about the local people who will probably approach you with their wares to sell, asking whether you'd prefer to buy something today or tomorrow, and giving you free advice/tips. There are also plenty of handicrafts shops along the way that could provide hours of fun trying out different types of items such as pottery, woodwork etc.\n\n3) The Sahara Desert - although not really considered \"a destination\" per se, this region offers breathtaking scenery with many scenic oases, waterfalls, cliffs, desert mountains and vast sand dunes stretching far into the horizon.

            "Keyhole is an optical telescope system launched as a military reconnaissance satellite by the USA during the early 1960s. The purpose of its development was primarily scientific (e.g., studies on geological activity) rather than for surveillance purposes or communication with ground stations; however it could provide telemetry data over extended periods through passive reception systems, and even direct downlink signals using relay satellites in space if needed. It used one 1m reflector (called [Aperture 1](_URL_1_) because this configuration maximized sensitivity while providing wide field views), although larger aperture versions did exist up to 6 m in diameter that allowed for increased spatial resolution (e.g., see the 3 meter diameter aperture 2B version). \n\nIn general the primary science instrument consisted of three separate telescopes - the Apertures which produced visible images of the sky and objects observed via two types of detectors: a high frequency infrared detector, sensitive between 10 cm wavelength (infrared region) and several mm range, capable of resolving structures ~5 microns in size and a more powerful [photomultiplier tube (PMT)](_URL_2_)(~50cm/25 inch tubes were typical, with some reaching 60cm long!) - producing information related to solar energy flux variations in Earth's atmosphere; a [radio detection receiver (RDR)](_URL_0_); also called \"Radio Interference Detector\" which could identify specific radio transmitters emitting strong emissions near frequencies that were close to those of interest. The final major instrument component of KHO-I involved another mirror system located below the Apertures to allow focusing onto target regions in order to enhance sensitivity when required; typically these were used in conjunction with either one of the aforementioned RDS receivers so as not to miss anything relevant (in practice such equipment has always been highly sophisticated anyway); I recall reading that they actually used these in the very earliest days!  [This article](_URL_3_) discusses briefly",
            "Keyhole satellite cameras: \n\n_URL_0_\n\n\nThere was also [another set](_URL_1_) which looked through other parts of Earth's orbit around it instead (like looking up at us) for objects too distant to get images from a satellite, such as near stars or nebulae like Sagittarius A*  or Andromeda. They did this for a long time, though there weren't any very successful observations until after 2001 - the reason we got images so close to those regions is that NASA started collecting data on all visible matter during an observing campaign known as *MOA*, whose main purpose is just gathering light data (as opposed to discovering planets). \n\n > Why do the Hubble telescopes point outward not towards Earth/planets/other stars etc.? \nIt turns out the Sun gets enough light reflected back toward us to provide sufficient energy input for its nuclear fusion cycle; therefore no additional telescope needed here either way! This fact was one major reason why it was possible to design and build HST, given its enormous budget relative to many competing space projects over decades of research, while many proposed probes suffered massive budget overruns. It seems clear to most people nowadays, based only upon recent evidence gathered from multiple spacecrafts now being in place or operational beyond the Solar System including several others that had been under construction or study prior to HST that HST does have unique abilities. \n\nBut it may surprise some to know that Hubble itself isn't even capable of pointing inward; however much money we put in Hubble has little impact compared with the total costs involved. There would always need to be someone available to look down on everything happening outside Hubble when doing things inside, something like [Keck](_URL_2_), except closer and without any requirement that we launch more observatories, if indeed our plans involve sending any sort of new equipment further into space anytime soon anyway<|endoftext|>"

The primary mission of the DSKY was military communications surveillance.  It did this through radio signals bounced off the ionosphere and received back by radar receivers mounted on the ground or other aircraft. This required relatively high performance antennas that could track the Doppler frequency shift caused by atmospheric motion, which would indicate the position of the source receiver relative to its own velocity. These were small parabolic dishes like those commonly found on amateur radio stations. \n\nThese were replaced during the 1980s with new types of spacecraft that could receive radio signals bouncing off Earth's surface instead.  A second generation system, DSCS, added infrared imaging capability, and finally another version called MDSK became operational around 2000. All three systems had fairly limited range; each antenna could see no more than 200 km above the horizon before being blocked by buildings, clouds, etc., and so most observations occurred when there was little light pollution overhead. <|endoftext|>"

In fact, due to how gravitation works, when everything orbits in the same direction like they do today its actually more accurate to call them 'clouds'. Clouds are just these things that hang out above the Earth. They're visible as white spots in your sky during sunny periods. Some of those clouds are even called cumulonimbus cloudstorms! That's where the thunder comes from. If you stood outside during summer nights, the clouds might block some of the light from reaching earth and make stuff dark. Or if there was heavy rain in a particular area then water particles coming down from space through atmosphere might get superheated enough to become steam/ice droplets and fall down over the cities below (these kinds of showers are sometimes called 'downburst' although that isn't really correct since the shower air goes up higher before falling back towards the surface). \n\n >  But suppose that the earth stops rotating.

It takes no more than 24 hours to orbit its star, although in practice [it has been known since at least 1998](_URL_4_).

Or does everything else stop when our atmosphere stops respirating because all the air will simply disappear? \n\nYou know how they say that things like methane can form naturally under extreme conditions but take many millions of years for it to appear? Well you'll need an enormous amount of solar energy to produce the conditions for biological creation today - billions per square kilometer. If your planet were big enough (even very small) then maybe we could get by - but large scale geological construction requires extremely rare, high pressures, lots of heat production which our world really doesn't have even near space stations let alone planets full of liquid hydrogen and asteroids..<|endoftext|>"

The problem here is that they can only move forward along their respective paths for a few days before colliding into each other again. So what happens when they stop moving? Well, they don't really have anywhere else to go because they've been traveling in a circle forever. They're stuck together!

The film has been widely considered one of the scariest films ever made because it remains incredibly effective at creating terror despite being shot on digital video technology. It was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won two Oscars\u2014one each for Jack Nicholson's performance as Jack Torrance and Shelley Winters' portrayal of Wendy Torrance. In addition to being a terrifying ghost story, it also features memorable lines like \"If there's no God then why do bad things happen?\" and \u201cThe dead never lie.\u201d<|endoftext|>",
            "The Shining is a psychological thriller directed by Stanley Kubrick, which follows Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), a writer who retreats to the Overlook Hotel as he begins to suffer from writer's block; his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and daughter Danny (Danny Lloyd) join him for their annual winter trip to Maine, but things quickly go awry when they arrive at the hotel, where strange events begin to happen around them. The film won seven Academy Awards including Best Picture, Directorial Achievement, Original Screenplay, Cinematography, Sound Mixing, Film Editing, and Art Direction/Set Decoration, among other awards.\n\nThe Silence of the Lambs is a suspense-horror movie set during the last days of the FBI academy, about Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster); she was sent undercover to kill her targets after getting caught shoplifting. She has an unlikely ally in the form of Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). In addition to its screenwriting team of Ted Tally and Joe Eszterhas, this film also stars Tom Berenger, Richard Jordan, and Famke Janssen. It received six Academy Award nominations: Best Supporting Actress (Foster); Best Actor (Hopkins); Best Adapted Screenplay; Best Writing, Based on Material Created Outside the United States (Tally & Eszterhas); and Best Production Design.<|endoftext|>"

            "The Conjuring is an effective psychological thriller set to make audiences jump at its frighteningly authentic, chilling scares. While this supernatural scare fest does feature plenty of frights, it's worth noting there was also a strong element of suspense involved. This is particularly important considering The Conjuring follows one man as he investigates the mysterious paranormal activity that plagues his family home, which includes multiple murders and unexplained occurrences involving spirits or demonic possession. It can be quite jarring for people who don't get freaked out by horror to suddenly start being scared during films they haven't been previously so afraid before - and yet that feeling comes over them just as much when it's a genuinely terrifying experience. There are no tricks or gimmicks employed here; everything happens exactly how you see on screen: without cuts between different shots or flashy camera movements to create drama, or other techniques meant to keep audience members entertained but distract from fear (as if those weren't already difficult enough!). In essence, these moments should have left their mark even on viewers unfamiliar with genre film making. But since they didn\u2019t leave such an impact on the moviegoers themselves \u2013 we\u2019re still watching a movie, after all \u2014 why do you think you shouldn\u2019t take risks with your work like that anymore?\"\nAs soon as any person becomes a producer of any sort, he starts to look into ways in which his productions may increase sales revenue through product placement.\"\nSo the guy gets more than he bargained for...\"<|endoftext|>",

This one is so popular because it actually gets really frightening when the characters aren't able to figure out what is going on around them, and even though the whole thing ends happily ever after (and it was all staged) it still managed to keep us guessing throughout until we found our happy ending at the end. The suspense is incredible, especially during the moments where they think there may be something real but don\u2019t realize that this ghost can literally just turn invisible at will if they don\u2019t see or touch it fast enough.<|endoftext|>"

            "There are many reasons why it can be difficult for someone in their mid-20s, or even late 20s (in the US), to land that coveted \"junior\" developer role. The first and most obvious reason has nothing at all to do with age; rather than simply looking out of work opportunities for young developers who may not have years' worth of experience under their belt yet, there's also often a significant amount of competition from experienced programmers willing to take on less senior roles - meaning that the odds aren't necessarily stacked against younger devs.\n\nAs well as this, it takes time and effort to gain professional experience through both internships and freelance contracts while working towards a career change like moving into development. For some people, having just completed university or college without any sort of professional degree would make them seem significantly older when compared to others with degrees. Additionally, hiring managers sometimes feel uncomfortable employing junior staff members due to an inherent risk that they might leave within the first year if things don't go smoothly, especially considering how much pressure employers put upon employees during their first few months of employment. This can mean that the company isn't comfortable offering junior positions because it feels too risky.\n\nThe last issue I'll touch on here is cultural: in certain cultures, it seems natural for more experienced colleagues to mentor newer team members. In Japan, where I am based currently, my current employer works hard to create mentoring relationships between senior developers and juniors so that everyone involved benefits. My co-workers always give me advice about what sorts of projects to pick up and what kinds of problems to avoid. These experiences help shape my understanding of the industry and its dynamics which will certainly aid my ability to perform better later down the line. \n\ntl;dr It's easier for companies to hire mid-level engineers since there's already a pool of talent available but harder for younger workers because they lack professional experience and fear losing a promising opportunity<|endoftext|>",

As you progress through the ranks in your career there will be greater focus on different areas of expertise - eg, you might start out being very strong at database design but move towards front-end web development over time (and maybe even take a couple years off between projects).\n3. Companies that employ junior developers often have multiple projects running simultaneously which can cause some delays or confusion for the team leader if they need to prioritise one project over another. This is especially common when starting up companies because it's so hard to manage such a large amount of staff all working on their own separate projects without any real coordination from senior management.\n4.

            "Restraint is a tool that has been used for centuries. In its most basic form, restraint was designed to stop animals (such as cows) eating their food too fast so they didn't eat everything at once and make them sick. This was an important function because many foods are highly toxic when consumed in excess; however, this practice would cause humans great harm if they were forced into abstinence for extended periods. It can also be applied by restricting physical movements such as kicking or hitting, but not with all animals - it works on horses best since those tend to be very responsive. Another type of restriction comes through verbal means where someone says 'don\u2019t' to a dog while pointing toward his mouth to encourage him to stop chewing, biting etc., though again some people prefer non-verbal techniques which don't have quite the same degree of effectiveness yet achieve much more rapid results. The final type I mentioned before involves physically restraining dogs. While we often see examples like the [photo below](_URL_0_) you will rarely come across actual human victims, just animals held down with chains attached around their neck or limbs. These kinds of things aren't seen in literature or media due to ethical reasons.<|endoftext|>",

In the Old Testament story, Joseph's brothers put him to death by throwing themselves down an embankment while he was in Egypt because they hated his wife Rachel (Genesis 37).\n\nIt would seem logical at first glance that such actions should be punishable with punishment as well--if you want revenge on your rival and take away some portion of their power through hurting them badly enough that they are forced into early retirement so you can keep doing what it takes to make sure you never get that kind of attention again. But we have to understand the difference between how our culture perceives the act and what happened behind the scenes in order to figure out why there wasn't any actual legal repercussions involved when the restrainers acted:\n\nJoseph did not know anything about restraining others before his life had been threatened several times over, even though it could be argued that God intended it as a punishment in advance anyway (he probably thought of this when Joseph complained of his treatment but decided to leave everything alone rather than fight back, see Genesis 42; 41:8-39) -- and therefore, according to Biblical logic, didn\u2019t do much wrong by just leaving it alone until after Joseph made good his escape plan, since nothing like the \u201ckill all those men\u201d incident really came up. This leads us right to where our current situation lies.\n\nAs we now see things were actually more complicated, because it turned out the reason that these events were considered a blessing was that no one realized Joseph would be successful at running off! When the other servants told Jacob the news that Joseph has fled and that everyone knew who did it without asking him directly if they were to report this, then he took his staff, set his face toward Gath and started marching southward quickly to pursue his runaway slave...

In the first place, I think you are correct in saying that it means he has taken steps to keep himself hidden. But there's much more than just keeping oneself hidden. For one thing, we see that he tried to make humans forget their Creator; for example he caused Adam and Eve to eat from the tree instead of the fruit they were told to avoid eating - but even after his defeat at the hands of the Lord, he continued to try. So while he tries to hide away from us, he also continues to attempt to distract us with false hopes and promises. This is why he is called \"Satan.\" The name comes from a Hebrew root meaning 'to conceal,' which makes sense considering his goal here - to prevent anyone from seeing him, lest they realize who he really is. \n\nIn addition to all this, though, he seems to have gone further than simply trying to get rid of any trace evidence of God on earth. We can find hints as far back into Genesis as 3:22 where Abraham asks if the LORD will destroy them before he dies. And later, we learn about Noah being warned to build an ark because of the flood coming upon the Earth. Now these two stories seem to point towards a time long ago in human history, possibly thousands of years prior to the events of Revelation - but they do give us some clues as to how Satan may behave today! \n\nFor one thing, notice that the flood happened only once, whereas the other events mentioned above occur repeatedly - sometimes several times per year, or perhaps every few days. If you take the Flood story literally, it appears that it must",
            "The Bible says that God has a plan for us. It also says we can choose not to be part of His will.\nThis leads into the concept of \"restrainers\", which are things that keep us out of our own destiny, whether through fear or temptation. For example: Satan was cast down from heaven because he tried to deceive Eve about what she should do with Adam and their offspring; Job had his wealth removed by God's servant (Satan); Moses was sent off alone on a rock so that the people could hear God speak directly to them instead of him having to go up Mount Sinai; etc...<|endoftext|>"

It makes a great destination on any summer or spring break road trip, so if this appeals then definitely check it out :)\n\nHere are two recent reviews by other traveler who took their kids there:\n* [4/5 Stars Review](_URL_1_)\n* [4/5 stars review ](_URL_0_)<|endoftext|>"

            "Some fun options that are only an hour or so away:\n1) Cabrillo National Monument - located in southern Monterey County is one of America's most beautiful natural attractions. This area is famous for its scenic beauty, rich wildlife habitat, unique geological formations, dramatic cliffs and colorful tide pools. There is plenty to see and do here! Take your pick of trails, explore the spectacular beaches and go on an unforgettable ocean snorkeling adventure. It can get pretty busy during summer months but there still many opportunities to escape crowds at low tides. If you're interested in visiting in wintertime (November through March), this park will be open then too with less crowds. \n\n2) The Mission Santa Barbara de La Purisima Missions State Historic Park - Founded by Spanish missionaries in 1782, these three mission ruins sit just south of Santa Barbara and make up part of the state's largest collection of historic missions. The oldest of the missions dates back to 1697 while the newer ones were built between 1826-1838. Each building has been restored and reconstructed to show what it looked like when it was originally constructed and is filled with amazing architecture including adobe walls, carved wood beams and ornate stonework.  This place is truly worth the visit if you have even half an hour spare time as well as lots of great photo ops.\n\n3) Pismo Beach - One of my favorite spots along the Central Coast is also easily accessible from San Diego via I-5 Northbound towards Lompoc/Pismo Beach exit #16 off I-5 South. Just over an hour from downtown San Diego, Pismo offers miles of beachfront where families enjoy swimming, surfing, fishing and picnicking under sunny skies. A nice walk around town and stop into some of the local shops and restaurants is always recommended.\n4) Hearst Castle - Located in Carmel, CA is known as the home of William Randolph",
            "San Diego is a beautiful city with lots to do. You can find plenty of great outdoor activities in San Diego such as surfing, biking, hiking, and kayaking. The weather there tends to be nice year-round so it's easy to go anywhere and enjoy the sunshine!\n\nSome popular things to see while in town include: -La Jolla Cove and Beaches -SeaWorld San Diego Zoo Sea World San Diego Aquarium USS Midway Museum and Naval Base Balboa Park Mission Beach (Mission Bay) Ocean Institute Pier Village (Downtown)  & more...<|endoftext|>"

There are also lots of other attractions like rollercoasters and water rides if they're into those things too.\n3) Legoland California - I know there aren't many people who have visited Lego Land but it's still worth checking out because it's just so much fun!

            "There are two types of training splits. First is the *cross-validation* (CV) approach, where you use an algorithm to divide your data into equal chunks and then run it on each chunk in turn until you get to some predefined point such as 100%. Then compare performance with other methods for that specific number of instances at this cutpoint, or similar approaches, to determine how good your method is at learning from data. This has become pretty common due to advances in computing power allowing people to perform many times larger sets of calculations than were previously possible so more information can be obtained quickly compared to other techniques when looking for trends etc., even though cross validation is only really appropriate if we want something simple like getting around 10% error rates (in case our models do worse). \n\nThe second type is the *holdout*, where the full set is left out while running through the entire process, including fitting models. So the idea is: instead of splitting your data 50/50 train vs test you give one third to testing but leave them out of all calculation entirely leaving only those three pieces behind, thus creating 'an artificial test'. In effect the model was never trained completely since no actual test exists; what does exist however are three complete tests - hence holdout! If any single part gets better, there will have been a genuine improvement, rather than just because it got a slightly smaller percentage correct in a less noisy situation which could also happen.\n\nNow both of these kinds of CV work by reducing down complexity without making much progress over standard techniques but I would suggest going straight ahead and doing it using your whole dataset for best results unless someone says otherwise, since you won't see any further improvements.

(source: [World Meteorological Organization](_URL_1_)<|endoftext|>",
            "There are a few different ways to answer this question.\n\nThe main source of heat comes from the sun, and is usually around -18 Celsius (0 F) during summer and about +5C during winter. This makes for very challenging conditions even compared with other places on Earth that have similar latitude. But the average air temperature doesn't tell you much: temperatures can vary by several degrees over short distances due to differences in local wind patterns.\n\nAnother issue when considering Antarctica's climate is its proximity to the ocean which brings about some interesting effects. The ocean acts as an enormous reservoir of heat, providing thermal energy to the continent through the water cycle; however, this also results in cooling at night time because most of this heat is transferred to the atmosphere above the surface. As such, the daily minimum high temperature averages close to zero Celsius despite being far south, while the maximum high temp only reaches minus 40 or so!\n\nFinally, there are two primary factors determining the length of each season. One is the length of daylight hours across the year, determined mainly by orbital variations, but more importantly is the amount of sunlight reaching Antarctica itself. Because we're talking about areas near the equator where the earth rises into the sun every day, there's not really any way to adjust these seasonal lengths without moving them further north or south (or changing the orbit). In practice though, those changes aren't practical since the continent sits atop large geological formations that prevent significant movement of land along existing fault lines.<|endoftext|>"

Here's how you can find out what day December 25th falls on in any given year using one method or another:\n\n1) The Gregorian calendar - This is the most common way to count down to Christmas because it uses the same date every year (December 25).  It has some drawbacks though; for example, if we were to use this system today, then January 1st would be counted as the first day of 2019 instead of 2018.  Also, there isn't really an easy way to figure out which years had leap years like 2016 did.\n2) The Julian calendar - This was used by the Romans when they created the calendar that we still use today.  This calendar doesn't have the problems with leap years that the Gregorian does, but it also doesn't account for the fact that our current calendar only goes up to about 4100 BC.  So while it gives us a good idea of how far away from Christmas we are right now, it won't give us very much information past that point.\n3) The Hebrew calendar - This is actually pretty similar to the Gregorian calendar, except that it counts backwards rather than forwards.  However, unlike the Gregorian calendar, it accounts for leap years correctly so that we don't end up counting back too far.  In addition, since it starts at the beginning of the Jewish year, it will always show the correct date no matter where you live.<|endoftext|>"

However it is likely that this was just a collection of wooden pieces that could be reassembled into something similar.  In fact one reason why people would use such structures as building materials may be because they were so light compared to other options. \n\nThe earliest mention of beeswax combs come from Ancient Egypt around 3000 BCE when Pharaoh Horemheb ordered beekeepers to make their own combs out of wax. In Greek mythology Apis was described as being created by Zeus from a comb of bees and later used as an image on coins representing King Apollo.\n\nHowever most sources point back to the Romans who believed that the invention came from the Persians who brought bees with them after conquering Iran circa 600BCE.

All the same, let me stress once again that she doesn't come along every day that would blow your mind, but perhaps today's story can teach us why Germany must continue sticking together regardless of whatever anybody says (even though nobody seems to know which way the wind might blow).

This gives you complete control over quality (but not price!)\n3) Buy from more organic/local farms whenever possible. This tends to lower the environmental impact while also improving quality overall because the animals don't face all the stresses other industrial farming practices place on their bodies.\n4) Use your profits towards community outreach initiatives. Whether that means paying out scholarships, building greenhouses for urban farmers, helping schools set up food justice programs....\n5) Utilize existing organizations working towards similar goals - many groups work across various aspects of agriculture such as anti-GMO advocacy and farm worker rights - maybe there's one who does specifically focus on livestock?<|endoftext|>",

We say 'that' when we are indicating an intended time (as opposed to just saying what something did), or as one example which may apply here: \n\n >  If he died right now; why would anyone go on living? \n\nAs an adult human - the context could make that statement be clear without saying 'the'; even children have come up with this usage without a word - but most people don't ever say such a thing because they want us to consider if there *is* someone else, who is alive while he's dead.\n\nThere's other uses of the phrase in both writing/communication, but more on that later. Now to get into our topic: In your situation these sounds represent different things in English depending on their placement at each point during speech. For instance [in American] \"third floor,\" can refer to an object placed between floors 2 and 3, which is higher than 1st floor, where there will also still be an item called \"3rd floor.\" One might see [more than once](_URL_0_) and thus understand one \"three\" to refer back to itself at all times until either being followed by another number or rephrased so it does not continue referring to anything specifically named.

For an example try 'fuck', where it's right there (but is almost silent). \n- Try moving it around - but carefully, since this may make things worse! \n\nFor all other situations, just learn by ear until they become good enough that when a word hits you as *Th*, the *T* sounds better than whatever's immediately before or after it<|endoftext|>"

The benefit in doing things together will create better connections much faster as well. \n\n* One popular approach is attending networking functions such as seminars, conferences, social events and professional development workshops all across town (or even farther away). These can offer great opportunities as often most attendees seem excited to connect informally before entering into the formal atmosphere - and once we join them there, we usually form great relationships that continue after those gatherings come and go. **It doesn't matter HOW you do it** -- whether walking around campus, sitting down outside a coffee shop, or sitting inside the conference room-- if you show up early then begin connecting people at their table (instead of standing there waiting until everyone fills the seats), keep smiling and introducing yourself enthusiastically (with enthusiasm!), and listen attentively while participating as an active participant, that group member or attendee may later become your friend, contact, or business referral network partner. \n\nJust remember though: don't overcommit to any one interaction unless you intend to followup and reconnect; always keep in mind that networking is still building and requires engagement over time and patience. Remember to ALWAYS ask for references",

Why should people buy their products instead of someone else's?\n\n* Identify the competition \u2013 Who are other companies competing against you? How do they differentiate themselves from each other? Do they have a unique offering or strategy that sets them apart?\n\n* Determine your ideal customer profile - Who are the people who would most likely purchase your product/service? Think of these individuals specifically when developing your message and messaging strategies.\n\n* Consider your target demographic - Is there anything specific about this age range that would make them more likely to consider buying this product than say, middle aged folks? Are there common hobbies or interests within this group that could lead to increased interest in your product?\n\nIf you'd like further guidance on how best to approach this project, please let me know and we'll take it from here.\n\n<|endoftext|>"

            "Of course! What kind of energy beverage are we talking about here? Let's start with developing some basic ideas based off this scenario.\n\nFirst let\u2019s think about what sort of message might be relevant and effective in reaching your ideal consumers: \"young adults from around 30 years old who crave something different.\" This seems like a good place to begin our brainstorming because it implies that this person has lived past the typical teenage years but is now looking for newer experiences and needs. There are multiple other factors at play such as their desire for independence and their overall lifestyle \u2013 do they value fashion over substance when compared to previous generations or does the younger generation love getting caught up in trends versus taking pride in true self expression? Knowing these things allows us to imagine how we could best present ourselves through marketing campaigns which would then appeal to people by emphasizing those same features. We can also come up with potential targets to communicate more effectively given the demographic range outlined above: there are many ways you can go about attracting the desired age group; perhaps one creative idea is to try to use design elements that draw inspiration from the latest music styles while staying in line with contemporary culture (think of all the neon colours). Then take a step back to reorientate yourself so instead of thinking of these people, you're actually imagining them having sex/drinking alcohol/loving sports cars. It may seem extreme, however if done cleverly, these images could capture your customers' attention even before you've finished saying hello - it's possible that once somebody finds out 'what you really look like', you'll receive compliments without knowing anything else... As I mentioned earlier, finding another way than 'kids nowadays...' or whatever gets annoying pretty quickly. So no, don't get me wrong here... If you put your mind into making sure not to say exactly what comes into your head (we are after all all creative enough), most likely the idea itself should stay relatively the same.

            "Yes, I would be happy to assist in creating a successful advertising campaign for your energy drink!\nThe first step towards success is selecting a target market - which should ideally represent all relevant demographics: age range (18\u201330), gender, geographic location, education level, income bracket, etc.\nNext, it's important to determine what specific demographic attributes are most crucial to the desired outcome of your campaign, such as current/aspirational consumer mindset regarding the product, their lifestyle choices, their attitudes toward purchasing habits, their willingness to pay, and so forth. These can be identified through qualitative research methods like focus groups or interviews with targeted consumers. Once this information has been gathered, you can then use quantitative data analysis techniques like statistical modelling to estimate the effectiveness of various marketing campaigns.\nOnce these steps have been completed, it's time to come up with creative ideas that align with the selected objectives. For example, if the goal is to increase awareness among potential buyers about the energy drink, consider incorporating social media influencers into your campaign. Or perhaps a video series highlighting some fun facts related to the brand could generate positive word-of-mouth publicity. Ultimately, it's important to test different strategies until you find one that resonates well with the intended target group.\nGood luck with your campaign!<|endoftext|>",
            "Sure! Creating effective ads can be challenging but I\u2019m here to make it easy by providing some tips that could benefit you in reaching this specific age group:\n\n1) Create Your Advertising Campaign\nYou should start with developing your message. Think about what kind of product or service would resonate well with your targeted demographic? What are their top concerns, frustrations, dreams, hopes, etc.? Identify your ideal customer profile so that you know who exactly they are. This helps ensure that you're able to tailor your marketing strategy to appeal directly to them. \n\n2) Select The Media Channels For Promotion\nConsider how you plan to distribute your ad through various forms of media like radio, TV, social media platforms, and print advertisements. Do research and see which mediums have been proven most successful at driving traffic towards certain products/services. \n\n3) Develop Key Messages And Slogan\nCreate concise messaging that communicates effectively within your chosen media channel(s). Consider using short sentences and bullet points when possible. Keep it simple yet impactful; focus on key concepts such as \"power\", \"energy\" or \"revolutionary\". Don't forget to test your ideas out before sending off the final draft! \n4) Choose The Right Platforms To Share It On\nUse social networks like Facebook and Twitter to share your advertisement on multiple platforms. These two platforms allow users to easily interact with each other and share content more broadly than traditional methods such as email blasts. Also consider adding QR codes or NFC tags (near field communication) into your design so that consumers can scan it quickly while browsing stores.\n5) Take Action!\nDon't forget to take action after sharing your ad. Utilize all available tools such as online tracking systems, call centers, email lists, or digital panels to track consumer responses. Measure success and adjust accordingly if necessary.\n\n<|endoftext|>"

Social networks such as YouTube, Instagram, Twitter etc.\n* Additional Activities Needed to Reach Goals - What other activities could make the biggest difference to reaching those goals?

Sansom\nIn a land ruled by magic, where gods are real and monsters walk among us, there is one man who stands between the people and their darkest fears - he's just a wizard on a quest to save them from themselves...\nOr at least that's what everyone says. But when a strange caravan appears in his home town with its head bowed low, leaving no trace but an abandoned wagon and a burned-out horse, it seems as though the old wizard may have been telling tales all along. Is this some kind of twisted joke? Or does something even darker lie behind these enigmatic strangers? As more clues begin to emerge, the question becomes: Who will be left standing after all?\n\nAuthor's Note: This story was inspired by the classic fairy tale The Wonderful Wizard Of Oz (Dorothy Gale), which I recently read for my writing class.

Each was prepared as best he could under the circumstances they would encounter during the trip\u2014whether it meant riding through treacherous mountain passes on unicorns (for instance), sailing upon winds in ancient ships of myth (as depicted in so many adventure movies), battling vicious dragons and other terrifying monsters in vast dungeons, traversing strange desert sands beneath blazing sun or stars. \n\nThey were well armed but still ready to defend against all odds, which brings us into our next piece. Our warrior friends were eager to fight the sorceror\u2019s evil forces when they came calling.

The brain doesn't want to spend any extra energy on remembering things if they aren't going to be used later.

This is also an issue with other power generation technologies such as gas turbines: if you can't reliably predict demand it's difficult to maintain the system properly and it tends not be well-suited for load following where electricity flows when it doesn't need to (this problem only becomes more severe once renewables reach 50% penetration). \n\nIn addition there is always room for improvements. If you take the most common forms of technology currently on offer today you will see their cost drop over time, allowing for increased uptake even now while new technology has yet to emerge. For example the costs associated with concentrating photovoltaics are already coming way below grid parity because they allow greater flexibility through the use of smaller cells per panel; and research into quantum dots promises better performance per watt by allowing individual atoms rather than large particles to act as conductors and emitters so you could build devices from very few atoms, which might eventually result in panels costing 10 times cheaper to run due to decreased production overheads etc...<|endoftext|>",

A good swordsman always had his sword close to them, whether they were standing guard with other guardsmen during times of peace or dueling others as part of some form of battle/combat. This way no matter where you were when things went wrong - in front of another guard while defending someone from harm's attack; against one's own troops after killing said soldiers or being forced into such a situation due to bad planning; in between fighting bouts in combat...they still held onto their weapon which was vital in order to keep themselves alive! \n\nIt also makes sense why many Samurai fought alongside the blade, not because of any spiritual reason but simply out of practicality: having the same thing around allowed you to defend yourself without even needing to take a swing! So a warrior who wanted a bit more speed would choose something smaller and less intimidating so he can be better suited towards a particular area, but it should also give him greater reach for a longer distance too, since you are now relying upon his accuracy instead of your ability to move faster. \n\nA few other examples might include: a man wearing a breastplate may opt to wear armour-piercing blades underneath those pieces in order to get closer shots or strike faster; whilst the armor worn by knights of old may consist mostly of plates, they sometimes added daggers and polearms in addition. In short, this is really only relevant for warfare in feudal Japan where people generally relied on the samurai's martial abilities to survive, but regardless the general rule applies across Asia, especially when compared to European culture and practice (though perhaps more than that actually)!<|endoftext|>",

As with most science fiction movies of this genre, there are multiple plot lines going simultaneously all over the world, but we focus mostly on one particular one: Sarah finds herself living out the consequences of a failed human-machine relationship between two women - both in love with their machines, and wanting desperately to save them both. This storyline leads us through some serious social commentary about technology and gender roles, while also offering some entertaining action sequences along the way. The dialogue is solidly written, with plenty of humor in every scene, making it easy to follow even if you don't speak English.<|endoftext|>",
            "Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles\n\nWhen I first saw the Terminator series, it was my favorite action movie of all time. But now that we're over two decades into its existence, and after countless sequels, prequels, remakes, reboots (the list goes on), it is still one of my favorites!\n\nIt's easy to get caught up in the storylines of movies like this, but Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles is more than just an average sequel; instead, it manages to be as good as any other installment with many memorable scenes, interesting characters, strong themes, and plenty of explosions! And for me personally, there are few shows or films which have managed to keep hold of such a loyal following through so much development. Many people argue that The Terminator franchise lost touch with what made the original work so well--but I disagree. For some reason, even though they've been around for almost 20 years, these films continue to stand out among their contemporaries because they stay true to who the main character actually is, rather than catering too heavily towards the plot points of the previous film. In fact, when you compare the events of The Terminator to those from other films about the same era, everything seems completely different; how could anything remotely resembling T2 ever come along? It took five decades before something similar happened again. That alone proves the quality of the original.\n\nI think it\u2019s important to understand where the original film stood compared to later installments, since this will help us better appreciate why these films can still appeal to fans despite their age and popularity. From the very beginning, the Terminator concept had already become outdated by the time it reached its conclusion; audiences didn't seem particularly thrilled with cyborgs running amok killing humans anymore. So the producers decided to turn things upside down, creating an antagonist not only far stronger than the Terminator himself, but also much more intelligent"

The story takes place in Los Angeles, California, two years following the events of Terminator: Sarah Connor (Sarah) has given birth to her daughter John Connor (Connor), but Sarah's body continues to age due to exposure to the nanomachines that have been developed from Skynet's designs by the military. Sarah is approached by Marcus Reese (Reyes), who tells her that he can save Sarah from aging and restore her youth using his \"time machine\" technology. However, when she arrives at Marcus' time portal, the portal disappears, leaving Sarah alone on Earth with the threat of Skynet growing stronger each day.\n\nThe film features Arnold Schwarzenegger reprising his role as cyborg killer Terminator, while Linda Hamilton returns for another performance as Sarah Connor, this time played by Edward Furlong. Other key cast members include Bruce Willis as Kyle Reese, Michael Biehn as Sgt. Robert 'Handsome' Johnson and Alan Tudyk as Trenchcoat. In addition, it includes supporting performances from many notable actors such as Lance Henriksen, Peter Stormare, William Baldwin, Lori Petty, David Warner and Christopher Lloyd, among others.\n\n<|endoftext|>",

The story takes place 15 years after the first film ended, when John Connor (Jason Clarke) has been born and his mother (Emilia Clarke), now played by Mackenzie Davis, has returned from the future with a new mission for her son: find a way to stop Skynet - which is humanity's self-aware computer AI program designed to wipe out all life in 2029. In order to do so, she will travel back into the past, meet up with old allies and use them to try and figure out how to destroy Skynet before it can become operational. However, things don't exactly go as planned. While they are trying to save mankind, they accidentally kill an important character that had no business being killed off.

As she struggles to find a way forward, she discovers that there are other forces at work trying to prevent her from achieving her destiny.\n\nOverall, Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles is a thrilling and exciting film that delivers a powerful message about the importance of family and the need to stand up for what you believe in.\n\n<|endoftext|>"

You have three different goals here:\n1) Control the flow of air so it matches your requirements for each room (and not just based on room temperature).  If you want a constant output, then a PI control would work well. If you wanted more precise regulation than that, there's a bunch of methods like RPM feedback loops and/or proportional integral derivative controllers out there which could help provide very tight regulation as long as they don't get too complex.  Achieving all 3 objectives simultaneously isn't always possible, but those 2 are usually easy enough to manage. \n\n2) Keep the system quiet and energy efficient. This means reducing the noise from moving parts. A PWM motor might not meet this goal because the current drawn is going into heating losses, whereas a brushless DC motor may not draw enough power. There's also heat issues involved depending on how fast you're running these fans, if you're using induction motors, etc. \n3) Provide safety features. This will depend heavily on where you're doing this and what sort of environments you're dealing with. I'd say a lot of safety engineering goes beyond simply monitoring voltage, frequency, phase angle, and temperature - think about the whole thing and make sure that any components you put together are designed to operate correctly under any circumstances.<|endoftext|>"

In this case there's no need for a complex system like a PID controller (or even a PWM signal), as it just needs to maintain the same speed regardless of what happens at any given point.\n\nThe most common method is to have each fan connected via a gearbox to the shaft which spins the drive wheel, so you can control the rotational velocity of the whole assembly using a geared down version of the motor/drive mechanism. This works well if all your motors/drives are exactly the right size, but it becomes much harder to manage if you want to change speeds over time - especially because you'll end up having to deal with backlash issues between gears, bearings etc. \n\nIf instead you use electric motors then you don't really need a geared mechanism; you'd simply run them at different voltages based on their position within the machine. If they're too close together, turn on more current than needed, otherwise cut back slightly. The advantage here though is that you get to keep track of the exact power used by individual machines without relying on a centralized unit like a DC-DC converter or voltage regulator - although you may still wish to do this if you find yourself dealing with loads above 100W.\n\nAnother option would be to use induction motors, where the magnetic field around the rotor creates a torque directly proportional to its speed (and hence also the speed of the fan). These tend not to require gearboxes or anything fancy, but they're quite expensive compared to traditional AC motors, and they suffer from poor efficiency due to the losses caused by eddy currents. I'm sure others will chime in on why this might make sense, but my personal view is that while induction motors are good for applications such as pumps where the flow doesn't matter very much, for something like a blower they're generally less efficient anyway.<|endoftext|>",

            "Sure! As you requested I would like to rewrite my previous response so that it is more accurate in terms of how we should be interacting with each other and what roles are expected from different parties involved in scientific communication (including myself).\n\nAs a non-native English speaker, one thing I have learned about writing is that there are some very important concepts which can often seem foreign or counterintuitive at first but upon closer examination become quite natural. For example, we don\u2019t really say \u201cI eat dinner every day\u201d because it sounds strange; rather we say \u201cI go to bed hungry every night\u201d. This may not make sense right away but by understanding why this happens we understand better how the language works. The same goes for many of the ideas presented here: they aren\u2019t necessarily new or innovative but instead represent just another way of expressing an idea that was already known before. So perhaps most importantly, keep these things in mind whenever reading/writing something down: read it out loud (and write it down again) if necessary. In doing so, try to remember whether your own wording has changed since you wrote it last time (it usually does!), especially if you find yourself using unfamiliar words/phrases. If everything seems fine then congratulations on successfully completing the task assigned to you - please let me know next time what changes need to happen :)\n\n<|endoftext|>",

However, this isn't what I wanted to discuss today\u2014what about ergonomics?\n\nThere's been a lot of research over recent years showing the positive effects ergonomic solutions can bring not only to our workplaces but also to overall employee productivity. These changes make it easier to stay focused on your tasks because you're more likely to remain physically fit; ergonomists have shown time after time that even minor improvements to a person's workspace improve efficiency dramatically, often doubling or tripling the results obtained from the same task. This means improved morale: better work is being done by everyone who does it! Plus there are countless studies that show companies which prioritize worker health experience increased productivity levels among both staff and clients. \n\nNow imagine these things applied directly into every single cubicle. You wouldn't just want a little thing here or a nice big touch up there - no sir. Your desk should reflect the values you stand for. Every part of the furniture must meet rigorous standards, and any imperfections would mean those items had to be removed completely from service. Think of the money spent if each chair has to go out of commission. Even a simple shift to slanted surfaces makes a difference, as does eliminating back pain through good posture. There really isn't anything we don't already do wrong. If someone could look down onto our desks from high above them like the vultures of yore with all of their stuff stacked together. They'd probably ask themselves why didn't somebody warn us when the tables were put away. Now, if the solution doesn't require replacing every individual piece then we need some way of keeping our coworkers' feet from slipping around and hurting them, too. Well luckily for you we live in an age where you get pretty much whatever size of desk you choose for $400-$700 depending upon its",

(For example, one person might have worked closely with computers throughout his career but never actually had them built specifically to meet their needs -- this has allowed him to use other options instead). \n\n3) Describe the importance of having high-quality office gear such as adjustable chairs, tables, etc.:  Ergonomic equipment helps make workers feel better, which leads to greater productivity, reduced sick leave costs, decreased absences due to injury or illness, higher levels of energy, less stress and strain overall...and more importantly, lower absenteeism rates and improved retention among employees who stay with organizations longer.

This means that many workers spend hours each day sitting down with poor posture and bad posture while working. It also leads to back pain, neck pain, shoulder pain, wrist pain, elbow pain, knee pain, hip pain, and even headaches. These problems affect both physical and mental performance which makes them harder to recover from than other types of work-related injuries like carpal tunnel syndrome.\n\nIn addition, there\u2019s no denying that having good ergonomic furniture helps reduce stress levels and improve overall wellbeing. Studies have shown that workers who use ergonomic chairs report feeling less stressed out and happier. In fact, some studies show that using ergonomic chairs reduces absenteeism by up to 20%!\n\nSo if you want your company to make its investment count, here's what you should do:\n\n1) Start by explaining the importance of ergonomic office supplies to your boss. Show him/her examples of previous research done on this topic and explain why it matters so much.\n2) Then talk about the benefits of investing in ergonomic products such as adjustable desks, ergonomic keyboards, adjustable monitors, adjustable chairs, etc.\n3) Finally, discuss the costs associated with these investments and how they'll pay off over time. Be sure to mention any potential savings on insurance premiums, sick leave payments, and lost productivity due to workplace accidents.\n4) Ask questions to get buy-in from your bosses before moving onto the next step. You may need to present additional evidence or data to support your case.\n5) Once all stakeholders agree to move forward, create a plan detailing exactly where the funds will come from (e.g., budget"

            "In practice, the output of an neuron is not completely determined by its input and weight. There are also other factors that affect it (such as membrane voltage).\n\nThe simplest way to think about this: imagine your brain is like a computer running on some software. The software runs in memory but you can make changes to it. When you run out of memory or power, your hardware dies and stops working. This is what happens when a neural network's neurons die/fuse; they stop functioning without any input signal being received for them. In our example above, if we remove all connections from one area to another, those areas will no longer communicate with eachother.\n\nSo, at first I thought \"a bias\" was just something that makes up for the lack of information, such as a little trickle of current to keep things going until more info arrives (which would otherwise cause everything to go dark) so that it doesn't look dead. However, you need a *sustained* flow of energy to maintain the functionality of the whole thing. So why don't we just put batteries inside every single connection between neurons?<|endoftext|>",

There is no need to have multiple units for each layer and, instead, there exists biases in the output node values which are ignored if they're set equal to zero or not set at all. In order to avoid overfitting a neural network with many parameters must have an architecture that limits these weights so that any neuron which fires will connect to all its inputs via a direct connection without passing through other areas except self-connections. This avoids introducing noise into the connections between neurons by making them parallel rather than serial links.<|endoftext|>",
            "Neuroscientists would probably tell you that biases are necessary. We don\u2019t have an exact answer for why neurons require them, and it is difficult to prove. However, some neurobiologists hypothesize these biases serve as signal-to-noise filters: They amplify/attenuate signals based on their previous experiences with similar situations or memories. This helps the brain identify relevant features in a stream of stimuli. Other biologist argue those same neuron have to learn their inputs because \u201cneurons never forget\u201d, they can remember any input, even if the environment changes significantly since then; e.g., your last trip to Disneyland or your cousin\u2019s birthday party when you were 7 years old (as both will likely happen). This idea seems counterintuitive at first but also suggests we need neural mechanisms to facilitate storage. In the case of plasticity, synaptic potentiation enhances firing rates by up to 50%. If such effects didn\u2019t exist there wouldn\u2019t be much reason to bother learning anything from experience<|endoftext|>"

            "A bias is needed to get the right result. \n\nIn deep learning, we need this because our neural network can not work in all situations and there are no universal functions (it just learns) so you have to add something that makes it think like other things happen if they did or don\u2019t happen when they didn\u2019t happen before. The best way to understand how an algorithm works with bias terms is through analogy. Think of it as a filter: your brain filters out irrelevant information and lets relevant information pass. You may remember this image from school - _URL_0_. Imagine two circles connected by a line, one circle represents the input data, another represent output data and a third circle representing some intermediate state. In the middle lies a line connecting both circles but instead of being straight it has kinks on each end; these represent bias values which control where the line goes relative to its neighbors. This process is called back-propagation. Now imagine your input and output layers look more like [this](_URL_1_) and let's say for simplicity's sake that you're trying to find the slope between x=3 and y = 1. Let's start at the bottom left corner of your diagram: you want the line going downwards. Your initial guess would probably be zero, because anything moving towards positive X should go upwards, right? Wrong! There exists such thing as a negative slope and positive slopes and so forth, and those sloped differently than you thought! If I had said 0, then the first bit of your program wouldn't know what to do, because nothing ever moves towards the left in my worldview. However, since we chose 3 and 1 as points along the axis, our model knows that there must exist a negative slope somewhere close to (-4,-2), but we couldn't see that until now. It was always just telling us about lines up/downwards without showing any of the intermediates along the way. To fix this problem",
            "You can also learn the input, but not all inputs are useful. This is because we don\u2019t have perfect knowledge of what causes something to happen. So when you put an input into your neuron and it fires then that\u2019s great \u2013 this tells us everything we need to know about why the thing happened!\n\nBut if our knowledge was wrong, say, it had no connection with the input at all or the right input wasn\u2019t given (maybe it just looked like it) then firing wouldn\u2019t tell us anything helpful. That would mean that we still couldn\u2019t figure out how to predict the outcome of something based on its previous history so far - for example if we wanted to predict whether a dog will eat cheese. We might want to include information from other dogs as well. \n\nSo now in addition to knowing what happens to make things work correctly, we want to add more knowledge to our system: \"this has always worked\". The idea here is that there should be some way of making sure that we\u2019re never caught without having learned anything relevant yet. To get around this problem, instead of including everything you think matters, we use the following trick: every time you feed it an input it remembers *how* it reacted last time and uses this \u201cmemory\u201d to update itself appropriately; that\u2019s called back-propagation. It works really well even though the model is completely random and doesn\u2019t contain any useful prior knowledge about how to react.<|endoftext|>"

In this case, if all the inputs had equal weight on every input node (and therefore were not biased), then the output would always be 0 or 1 because that's the only solution with no error. However, if we introduce some bias into the network by giving each input different weight, then now there might actually be two solutions for each output value depending on where those biases land.

In that time it's gone through some ups and downs in price but it remains at its current market cap of roughly $70 billion dollars despite having experienced periods where there was no one actively trading it or holding any assets associated with it. The total supply is limited to 21 million coins which are not created unless miners find them, so as long as demand continues then we will have a finite number of units available regardless of their current worth. If they were being sold today, someone would pay $1,000 per coin for the privilege, right now the cost of each unit might be slightly more than $10 (I'm not sure off hand), so even if people want bitcoin they won't get very much out of the process - although perhaps that'll change once other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum or Litecoin become widely used too. \n\nThat said, the reason why Bitcoin prices seem volatile is because while many different factors influence exchange rates between currencies, Bitcoin is an exception due to how unique it is. Unlike traditional fiat currency, Bitcoins aren't issued from government coffers and instead come about from mining activities; thus there isn't a single central authority who controls their creation. It doesn't take much imagination to see why this could cause problems should the community decide that something needs fixing or changes need to occur. There is also little control over Bitcoin transactions and as such those looking to exploit weaknesses may be able to do so easier without the scrutiny that comes with being under a larger bank account or backed by physical currency.<|endoftext|>",

            "Sure! I'll give a general overview of the way my research is conducted. Here's an outline:\n\n1) Define your problem(s): This should be as specific as possible to make sure that all relevant literature can be found and assessed for relevance. It might help if you provide more information about what type of study or analysis you're interested in (e.g., statistical method, sampling strategy), what data sources are available, etc.\n2) Select appropriate methods/approaches: These could range from traditional statistical analyses such as regression models and hypothesis testing to newer computational approaches like machine learning algorithms or deep neural networks. You may want to consult with experts on these topics before selecting one approach over another. For example, consider consulting statisticians who specialize in analyzing large datasets using modern techniques like random forests or kernel machines; they would likely have much better insights into which model best fits your needs than someone who specializes only in classic linear algebra and statistics. The choice will depend largely on both practicality and feasibility - if some other option seems promising but isn't feasible for whatever reason (budget, time, expertise,...) it might still be worth considering!\n3) Conduct and analyze your studies: Again, this depends heavily on the specifics of your project so it's important to clarify the goal first. A common approach here is to build predictive models based on historical observations and compare them against new ones collected after some change has taken place. If there are many factors involved, you may need multiple sub-studies, each focusing on different aspects of the system at hand. Each step of the process (i.e., collecting data, developing methods, modeling results, interpreting findings, writing up the paper, submitting it to a journal...) must be carefully planned out and documented to ensure that everything goes smoothly and accurately. Once you've developed your study design, you can go ahead and start conducting and evaluating it by applying various methodologies such as cross-validation, validation sets,",
            "Hiya! I'm sorry that this is so difficult to answer. In the past I've described my process as something like a \"sieve\" or a filter (rather than a sorter), but really it's just a bunch of rules for selecting which things are included into your data set based on what they look like at the time of their arrival in your lab. \n\nThe basic method can be divided up roughly into two categories: 1) those where you sort each object by its appearance during the sorting period, and 2) those where objects arrive in bulk form with no sort order applied, such as during sample preparation or during data acquisition (though some may say there isn't really any kind of separation occurring).\n\nIn both cases, however, an algorithm is used to determine if an item should remain in your dataset (and potentially add/delete from it) based upon various criteria including size, shape, texture, color, etc... This is typically done using a computer vision approach similar to image recognition, though there are many different algorithms available depending on exactly what type of task you're trying to accomplish. The algorithm works out the most likely way to classify each new incoming item according to these criteria, then simply records whether items were classified correctly vs incorrectly and which category was predicted best based on all the information about that individual item.\n\nWhen we talk about a visual algorithm being trained against a human-provided label for classification purposes, I mean training is only part of the whole thing; real world use requires validation too - determining when an algorithm has actually learned enough to function properly and accurately without needing additional tuning. It's important to remember that even well-trained algorithms will have trouble classifying absolutely everything perfectly because it takes more experience to recognize patterns reliably, especially across very large numbers of instances, and also because humans don't always get everything right.<|endoftext|>"

There is no universally correct method to draw inferences from many types of data - it comes down to what type of analysis you want done most efficiently/quickly.\n\nA second technique I sometimes employ involves creating summary statistics such as mean(x), median x values, min(x) etc. You can then run multiple regressions where you predict each y value using both these predictors and other potentially relevant variables. The resulting predicted response tends to be fairly close to being unbiased estimates of the true mean and sd of y given a specific set up / specification. \n\nSometimes a third approach involves visual inspection. If there's a clear pattern emerging within any group or subgroups I'll create scatter plots that show all predictor combinations against each response point so you can get an idea if patterns emerge across groups. This may not always pan out though since the datasets could simply have been generated by chance outcomes with no underlying pattern(s).<|endoftext|>",

            "Sure! Here are the steps I take when writing code to implement a given algorithm:\n1. Decide on a programming language for the problem at hand - this is often Java (Java), C++ or Python depending on what kind of performance/memory issues need to be taken into account. \n 2. Write down an abstract high-level description of the algorithms that will be implemented in your code; it's good practice here to use pseudocode so others can easily understand what exactly needs to happen. \n 3. Implement the algorithms one by one using appropriate tools like IDEs and editors such as Eclipse. Make sure that each step works correctly before moving onto another. You may also want to test some simple examples beforehand. This allows you to identify bugs early and fix them quickly without having to rewrite large chunks of the program from scratch. \n 4. Once everything has been completed, go back over the implementation with a fine-tooth comb to ensure all possible corner cases have been considered. <|endoftext|>",
            "Sure! Here's a more specific example of how I use my knowledge to answer questions:\n\nQuestion: What is the maximum number of points that could possibly be added on an x-y graph? \n\nMy Response: The maximum number of points that can ever be added to any given point (on an x-y chart) depends entirely upon the type of data being graphed. For example, if you have two lines with no intersections whatsoever then there would not technically exist \"points\" which could actually be placed onto these lines; this means that adding any amount of points at all will result only in a line segment - or a single \"point\". This is because each intersection represents one point. However, if you had two intersecting curves (such as those found between mountains and valleys), it wouldn't really make sense to add any additional points to them since they represent distinct regions of space. Therefore, we need to define what we mean by *maximum* before determining how many new points are possible for such a system. To do so, we first must establish the area under our original curve(s). We can find the area of any curve using its formula A = \u222b y dx. Then, knowing the area of your original curve, we determine the total length of all the segments created from it. Since these segments are straight lines connecting adjacent vertices along their respective axes, the sum of all lengths of these segments equals the total length of our original curve. Finally, when considering the total distance traveled over a unit time interval, we know that the speed of light c  = 300 000 km/sec, meaning that the maximum speed of movement per second across any given surface is 299 000 m/second. So, taking everything together we see that the highest possible rate of addition of points to our original plot is limited by 299 000 m / s.<|endoftext|>"

Start by gathering the necessary materials - I use cardboard, paper, scissors, glue, paint, etc. to create my model. You can also use other materials such as clay or foam if that is more convenient for your project.\n2. Design the shape of your object using basic shapes like circles, squares, triangles, rectangles, etc. This will help guide you when it comes time to cut out the pieces.\n3. Cut out each piece with a sharp pair of scissors. Make sure to keep all edges straight so they don't get damaged during assembly later on.\n4. Glue any loose parts together (such as the corners) before assembling them into one solid structure.\n5. Paint the entire model with acrylic paints or other suitable mediums depending on the desired look.\n6. Allow the paint to dry completely before moving onto step 7.\n7. Use a hot knife or laser cutter to carve out the design from the surface of the model. Be careful not to damage the underlying layers while doing this.\n8. Once the design has been carved out, carefully remove the excess material around the edges.\n9. Finally, assemble the individual components into their final form.\n\n<|endoftext|>"

There are many different sub-fields within this broad category, and I am not familiar with all of them, but there have been several interesting developments recently:\n\n1) There was a big push for open source development on the Amazon Web Services platform back in 2014 or 2015, which led to an influx of open source software projects being deployed at AWS -- most notably Docker and Elastic Beanstalk;\n2) In 2018, Microsoft announced their Azure AI & Research group, whose primary focus will be building out the infrastructure required to run machine learning algorithms and deep neural networks using Microsoft's cloud computing services;\n3) A recent study from Google showed that machine learning models can reduce server costs by as much as 70%, leading to further interest in ML technologies such as TensorFlow, Keras, etc.;\n4) Many other companies, including Facebook and Uber, are also investing heavily into artificial intelligence research, with some even making headlines like \"AI Will Soon Be Better Than Humans At Almost Everything\";<|endoftext|>",
            "Yes, I am familiar with the subject of Software and/or Reliability Engineering (SRE). It is a subfield within software engineering that focuses on improving system reliability by creating systems that are more robust to failure. The goal of SRE is to make systems that will be able to handle unexpected failures or incidents without disrupting operations for customers.\n\nOne common use case of SRE is when there has been an incident in which something goes wrong. In this situation, it may help to create backups so that if there were problems after the initial failure, they could still continue running unaffected until someone was able to restore things from backup. Additionally, monitoring can also provide useful information during periods where things have gone wrong as well as identify any trends over time.\n\nIn terms of how people do these kinds of jobs, some examples include:\n\n * DevOps engineers who work directly alongside developers and deploy new code into production at regular intervals\n\n * Technical project managers responsible for making sure projects meet deadlines and budgets while maintaining high levels of quality control\n\n * Systems administrators tasked with managing server hardware and network connectivity infrastructure across multiple teams and geographies<|endoftext|>"

These builders typically work directly on code rather than writing documentation or working with product managers to understand requirements and priorities.\n\n\n* *Maintenance Engineers*: Keep existing systems running smoothly by fixing bugs, optimizing performance, improving security measures and so forth. They may need some technical expertise to be able to perform these tasks but they can often rely more heavily on domain knowledge than their counterparts in the build team.\n\n\n* *Operations Engineers*: Manage infrastructure services such as storage, databases, networking and servers, ensuring availability of resources and reliability when needed.

You can read more about that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Matrix/comments/6p1d8b/_URL_3_.htm). Here's an overview of how it works:\n\nThe main thing here is the function `send()` where we are sending messages via room system through our `AsyncClient`. It takes one argument called `message` with body being passed along and also allows us to pass custom callbacks like this one `message_callback_send`. The callback gets invoked when we receive some events from server, in our case its just simple text message so let's assume that `Event` class has following methods available for you:\n\n* `body`: This contains the actual message body. In your case this would be the string you want to send out to all other users who were in same room at time.\n\nYou need to provide some sort of logging facility on your end, since you might not know what happens under the hood after you make the connection and start communicating. That said there should always be some sort of logging going on anyway. Let's log it in debug mode first, if that helps:\n\n```\n_logger.debug(f\"Connected to Matrix.\")\n\n_logger.debug(f\"`rooms` method returned [{}]\".format(_room.__class__) )\n```\n\nSo now you have two ways of accessing your logs depending on whether you used debug mode or normal mode. For regular use I recommend starting off by enabling debugging on Matrix itself by setting environment variable `ELECTRONICITY_DEBUG_LEVEL=4` but if you prefer having access to them only inside your program then feel free to comment out these lines. If you do disable this setting everything should work fine without additional problems. Now we're ready to actually run this piece of code",

This typically includes paying living expenses during school until one finds a job after graduation.\n\n\nA common strategy is that students can complete 1st year JDs, 2nd years LLMs, go back to the old school and take up some low level clerkship positions where you pick cases to study on. \n\nNot all programs reward this option however (some don't want a class of 60+ people who aren't actually practicing lawyers), so I'd assume it would depend heavily on where a student attends college and how willing a given program wants its alumni to be involved locally/internationally.<|endoftext|>",

These include Universities like McMaster University and Toronto School of Business which offer courses such as International Law & Global Business. This route typically takes about five years for undergraduate degrees depending on program. Depending on if you go for full time, part time or online mode you can expect some level of debt from this option due to tuition costs but also from other financial investments such as fees for books etc. \n    **Note**: This path will only give you the theoretical knowledge at best; actual practice experience is virtually non existent unless you study abroad. Most schools do not have any foreign law students currently enrolled so all knowledge derived from coursework needs to be obtained by means external to the student's institution - mainly independent research under supervision of experts. \n\n  However there are still many Canadian universities offering the LLM program with options varying including in year programs or distance learning / distance learning options.\n\n 2) Direct entry into professional organizations such as LCMA where they hire professors or attorneys who have gone before them. For example I am associated with Strasbourg, France with its European Center for Constitutional Court. This type allows you access to practicing judges while covering your expenses. However no longer exists the old \"European Commission\" - these were basically staff positions funded by member states and employed mostly former national court officials from countries that joined within days or weeks after entering EU institutions.<|endoftext|>"

There have been cases reported on reddit where users consumed extremely high levels (in some instances upwards to 30 grams per day) and were said to become \u201cunresponsive\u201d or lose control for short periods of time as a result. Some also fear its ability to bind with CB1 receptors within your body\u2019s brain tissue causing unwanted changes, although there isn't any scientific evidence suggesting this yet. The main thing I think most people need to realize about cannabinoids is they do not get you high, no matter what you believe someone has told you before. Cannabis contains several other chemical compounds which may produce a more pleasurable effect when combined with cannabidiol, such as tetrahydrocannabinol THC or CBN. It does contain other compounds that interact differently from these chemicals. These compounds are responsible for creating different feelings associated with marijuana use compared to regular smoking. So, just like every person can only take so many hits of beer until he becomes unsteady and sick-ish then that happens all the time! You cannot say the same applies here since there will be times we can handle 10 gm but if it's going down quickly, even one hit makes us sick/not feeling good because it was already taken. If we keep up the intake without being careful enough though... Well.. Then maybe that is a bad idea for us? We would likely overdose fast by eating 10 gm straight unless our body doesn't absorb very well into cells (I've read studies that suggest cannabis uptake gets slower after it leaves blood). Also remember: 1 gram is 100 mg (and you'll never find 0mg!). This dose seems relatively harmless and easy to ingest but let's imagine an example; 10 grams over 8 hours, yes.

These features make Java an ideal programming platform, providing the tools necessary to build applications quickly and easily without compromising quality.<|endoftext|>",

It means that you must declare variables as static instead of dynamic. This makes sure your code doesn't change while running. Dynamic typing allows the programmer to assign values to variables at run time based on data from outside the function. In other words, variable assignment happens during runtime which requires more effort from developers compared to static typing since the process will vary each time depending upon external information available. Compiled or interpreted language executes instructions directly without having an intermediate representation such as machine code. Interpreting involves translating some source language text into another form suitable for processing by a computer processor. Interpreted languages also tend to be slower than compilers due to their lack of built-in optimizations. However, programmers who choose interpreted languages often find them easier to understand because they don't require explicit declarations about what's going on behind the scenes<|endoftext|>"

Type systems are important because it ensures correct programs that respect constraints specified up front without relying on programmer judgment, allowing us to ensure that our implementations behave correctly as intended when executed under particular conditions. Dynamic typing describes languages where the meaning of the symbols changes based upon context. It does not enforce the semantics explicitly, although programmers will typically know the behavior if the same expression was written out twice, or three times from another context than where they originally appeared.

A compiler will use its knowledge of the structure of the code being run against your intentions and perform an optimization based upon this information. Dynamically typed languages (DMLs) such as Python allow you to specify values directly while compiling. Compiling happens immediately at runtime instead of after execution of every single line. Interpreted programs, meanwhile, must still interpret their source codes prior to executing them, resulting in more efficient execution compared to compilation. There isn't really a universal way that you'd compare one to another so I don't think we should make a recommendation just yet.

With dynamic programs, the programmer doesn't have access to all the details of a program's structure until runtime - when he wants to make changes, for example.

Religious scripture/mythology?\n - Are they influenced by politics? Cultural trends? Religion? \n\nNow we can begin exploring the various reasons that make someone have a certain viewpoint about the universe:\n\n 1. Beliefs regarding reality as opposed to the perception you receive when observing reality: **Is their worldview accurate?** Do people actually see what is there rather than interpreting reality through a lens created for them to see the same things that everyone else does (which might not be correct)?  Does anyone truly believe the story being told even though the author has been corrupted? This goes beyond religious dogma too, many cult leaders claim they know all true religion yet most follow very strange teachings that don't fit into mainstream beliefs like Buddhism. There are some pretty outlandish religions where no two people ever meet who think alike such as Theravada Buddhists who have different ideas depending upon whether your question is asking \"is my experience real\" vs if I am seeing myself inside other peoples minds? These people aren't necessarily crazy, just living life outside normal parameters because those who choose these types of lives will likely go nuts before long without guidance and probably need psychiatric help more often then you do with depression! \n2. Personal experiences or personal meaning of experiences in general; what causes the mind to latch onto particular themes despite being unable to logically justify them or give a solid logical basis to explain how these themes exist in any sort of meaningful way?: What causes me to perceive certain objects, concepts or actions in certain ways, even when those perceptions conflict with rational thinking or evidence available?

Such creatures will always exist alongside our current selves - though there is much more potential that could potentially emerge in terms of their development if they were able to come into being without first having experienced physical existence on earth. For such creatures, there would no longer need to be anything like \"I\" since any thoughts and emotions which arose within them wouldn't even involve their own experiences but instead only the thoughts/feelings/emotions generated by whatever consciousness was controlling their bodies during that time. It's not necessarily easy to explain this idea concisely because one must contend with several layers of concepts, but my intention has been simply to suggest something akin to an extreme case scenario. To clarify further:\n\n >  There can also be little sense in speaking of \"God.\" There cannot truly ever exist a god.

            "Hello! Welcome to AskHistorians!\n\nToday I am going to explain why people believe what they do about the world around them by providing you with an overview of one specific view that has been presented throughout history: Christian worldview.\n\n & nbsp; \n\nThe basic premise is that everything we see exists as part of God\u2019s creation (i.e., nature), and that it was made so for a reason (the divine plan). In addition, humans have free will which allows us to choose our path in life through actions such as belief or unbelief (which are seen as choices) but also through choice in diet (aspects like meat consumption) or other behaviors that may not be aligned with beliefs/worldviews of others. As we learn more about ourselves, we come to understand that this all fits into some larger purpose of how things were created, including even events such as natural disasters, which can often lead to greater understanding. For example, the [tornado](_URL_1_) occurred because winds overheated during certain periods when the sun had moved behind clouds and allowed air to move between different areas. The storm then picked up speed until its strength reached maximum speeds whereupon the funnel effect increased its force due to gravity pulling downwards on itself causing tornadoes to spin upwards faster than usual, resulting in strong winds being formed.<|endoftext|>",
            "\"I have written extensively on this topic before; you can find it [here](_URL_0_). However, I want to go into greater depth with regard to the relationship between the individual\u2019s world view (the way that they perceive their environment) and the meaning or purpose of life.\n\nFirstly, let me make something clear: we cannot truly understand our own lives unless we take the time to examine how others see things too. It is impossible for us to really know ourselves without knowing what other people think about who we are. In fact, we will often discover that some parts of our personalities which we initially thought were uniquely ours are actually more like characteristics shared by many different individuals than one single person. The same goes for beliefs as well - when someone believes something, whether because he was told so or because it has become part of his personality, it is almost always easier to identify those aspects of oneself that correspond with them rather than identifying elements that don't align. For example, if my partner says \u201cI believe that all humans should be treated equally\u201d, then it is easy enough for me to recognise myself within that belief \u2013 even though I might not share that particular viewpoint at present!\n\nHowever, just because these beliefs do appear common amongst most members of society doesn\u2019t mean that they reflect reality accurately. To quote Carl Jung once again, \u201c[i]f man is able to create his own values, there remains only the task of giving them substance\u201d. If a value is created solely based upon the idea of \u2018fairness\u2019, but lacks any basis in objective reality, then its validity becomes questionable. This isn\u2019t necessarily saying anything bad about equality itself \u2013 it could simply indicate that everyone agrees that equality exists, yet no evidence suggests otherwise. Likewise, it could also imply that fairness is inherently subjective and thus does not exist independently of human perceptions. In both cases, the problem lies with how much credence we place upon certain values and ideas, rather"

For example, when considering the concept of *religion*, it seems logical to consider how individuals understand their own religious experiences, as such they will also tend towards a particular understanding of what constitutes God/Religion/Godhead; likewise, people who experience a different world view than yours may be more inclined to see things in light of that viewpoint. This means that while our perceptions can change over time (and indeed do so), our views on what defines reality remain relatively constant - at least until someone changes his mind. In fact, if anything, our views become even stronger through repeated reflection upon them since we begin to develop new beliefs based on our initial assumptions and conclusions. Thus, it appears likely that most people hold similar ideas around the nature of reality despite having differing personal interpretations of those concepts due to differences in cultural influences and upbringing.\n\nHowever, regardless of whether or not a given individual holds the same beliefs across all domains, he or she still has access to certain commonalities with other persons holding the same beliefs (or opposing ones). These similarities provide us with a shared language which allows us to interact effectively and efficiently, especially in situations where communication requires mutual comprehension of each party' s point of view. Additionally, by recognizing the value of diversity in belief systems, society gains a greater sense of cohesion, unity, and purposefulness. Furthermore, because our worldview is shaped by the unique experiences and contexts that we encounter, its influence extends beyond our immediate",
            "The World view is the way that people see themselves as being connected to everything else in this world. For example, when you go out on vacation or travel somewhere new, it\u2019s important for you to make sure you know what your home country looks like so that you can feel at ease while traveling abroad. Similarly, if someone asks where they are from, their first instinct might be \u201cI don't want to say\u201d because it makes them uncomfortable knowing how other cultures perceive them. The Worldview helps us navigate through life by understanding who we really are and why we do things the way that we do.\n\n  In psychology, there has been a great deal of research into the relationship between our World views, beliefs about ourselves and the external world around us, and various psychological issues such as depression, anxiety disorders, stress, and addiction. However, until recently most of these studies have focused exclusively upon Western culture due to its prominence as one of humanity\u2019s oldest civilizations. In recent years however, scholars from many diverse disciplines (including anthropology, philosophy, history, sociology, theology, linguistics, economics) have begun examining the ways in which different cultures understand the nature of reality and human existence. These investigations reveal striking differences in the way individuals across time and space think about the world around them - some more pessimistic than others - even among those with similar experiences. \n\nIt should come as no surprise then that the Worldview affects every aspect of our lives including: relationships, career development, spirituality, health, social networks, politics and religion. It is therefore critical that all members of society recognize that their individual perspectives and interpretations may not reflect universally shared assumptions regarding the meaning of the self, the universe, or anything else in the world; and that they actively engage in dialogues about these topics, rather than simply accepting unquestioned cultural norms.<|endoftext|>"

[See this article](_URL_0_) from the University of Minnesota Press regarding other common festivals/holidays found among various peoples across the globe:\n\n >  In many parts of Africa today you will find three major events, namely, New Year's Day, Eid al-Adha (\"Day of Sacrifice\"), and Eid al-Fitr (\u201cFeast of Breaking Fast\u201d), whereas elsewhere they may be called simply Festivals or Holidays because they have become so popularly associated with the annual cycle of life. The first two are obviously related to the lunar calendar. But where exactly does the third fit into the seasonal pattern? This kind of thing depends largely upon whether the Muslim religion is considered to be based primarily upon the sun or moon. According to the former interpretation, the holy month of Ramadan falls at approximately the same time every year regardless of local latitude or longitude. On the other hand, according to the latter interpretation, Ramadan varies considerably both seasonally and geographically and therefore cannot serve as an accurate marker of the annual solar revolution.<|endoftext|>"

The code iterates through each element in both lists, comparing their values until they are found to be equal or greater than their neighbors (the \"next\" value). Once such comparison has been made, it replaces the current element with its neighbor's value.

This type of research aims to reconcile general relativity with quantum mechanics, providing a framework in which these two theories can work together seamlessly and successfully as a single unified theory of all known physical phenomena. One area of focus within this field of study involves quantizing gravity - understanding how to treat it as if it were made up of fundamental particles called gravitons. It's not quite clear whether quantum effects should even show up when studying black holes, since we have no direct experimental evidence for them, but theorists believe they're inevitable, especially in strong gravitational fields such as those around compact objects like stars or planets. In other words, some experts predict that black hole physics will soon undergo major changes because quantum mechanics might take over once more from the classical rules used so far to calculate orbits of test masses inside massive black holes.<|endoftext|>",
            "Quantum gravity is the theory of spacetime itself, not just matter and energy. In classical general relativity (the theory of spacetime) it was postulated that spacetime is curved in a very small neighborhood of every point in space; however this hypothesis could be challenged because it seems inconsistent with certain observations about gravitational radiation or the cosmic microwave background temperature spectrum. In quantum general relativity there are two key differences from traditional GR: first, all information we have ever learned about nature comes down to its properties at low energies (and perhaps high temperatures), whereas traditional general relativity assumes information has no such low-energy limits but instead describes all information at large scales through classical gravity, which becomes valid only for large masses; second, in order to explain quantum behavior within conventional general relativity (which applies for most situations outside black holes) one needs some kind of extra \"spacetime\" term in the action principle describing what would otherwise happen due to ordinary geometry. These points make it seem unlikely that standard quantum field theories can adequately describe fundamental interactions in spacetime, making new theoretical ideas necessary.\n\n<|endoftext|>"

In this picture, quantum mechanics does not apply to the smallest scales (the Planck scale), which leads to many unanswered questions about the nature of quantum physics at such length scales.\n\nAnother major issue with quantum gravity concerns causality: how can we talk about the evolution of physical systems without being able to make instantaneous measurements? This problem has been particularly difficult for quantum field theories because they are based on interacting fields whose dynamics cannot be determined from first principles. One solution proposed by Hawking and others involves modifying general relativity so that certain gravitational quantities have negative kinetic terms instead of positive ones.

The current leading candidate for such a theory is String Theory; but there remains much work ahead before any firm conclusions can be drawn.\n\nThere are several important recent developments relating to quantum gravity, including:\n\n * Observation of gravitational waves from merging black holes.

This means that you can write the lyrics in any key you want, but your melody will most likely not sound like what you expect unless there's some way to relate them together with the chord progressions.\n\nSome folks have more experience creating these kinds of things, so if you're looking for something specific you may get better results by asking about how to compose \"a traditional folk\" song instead of just one particular genre as this might include other features besides the basic melodic structure (for instance, if you were writing a country song you'd probably use a lot of different harmonic structures).<|endoftext|>"

Look at popular songs like Adele for ideas. Once you've figured out some parts which fit together well, build off those foundations by adding new notes/rhythms, experimenting with other scales etc. \n\n3) Combine a preexisting motif (a pattern recurring throughout the piece) to connect melodies (Eg: Ooooh eeevaaah ooouuuu Aaah) \n\n4) Make your melody more abstract by varying pitch ranges, using parallel phrases, layering instruments etc<|endoftext|>"

            "I think the most important thing to know about making a pop or rock song is that it\u2019s all in how you write, arrange and produce them. It might sound simple but if your song sounds like someone else\u2019s then something isn\u2019t working right for you.\n\nThere are several ways of writing songs: The traditional way was called 'The Beat' (think Elvis) where each chord was written with every note played at its correct time; A more modern method used by bands such as Green Day uses the 4/4 time signature and allows some variation between the first 3 notes so they don't sound too similar to one another - this technique has become popularly known as \"Metal\" music. You can use these methods together but the key thing is that the whole band will work out their own rhythm on top of the original beat which creates what we call the \"rhythm track\". \n\nThen comes the arranging process - arranger's are musicians who specialise in helping other musicians create songs and arrangements using a combination of both technical knowledge and creative input from themselves and the musician playing their instrument. There are many different techniques used in arranging - for example there may be specific patterns created before the arrangement starts that tell the composer when he needs to change tempo or volume etc... Sometimes these patterns may have been set up by the composer before the piece even begins but often they'll just appear organically during rehearsals or recording sessions. Then come the production elements such as mixing and mastering the song and putting everything together into an album or single ready to go. This usually involves creating digital files and editing those down onto CD-quality audio tapes, DVDs, CDs and online platforms to send to labels, producers and publishers to distribute worldwide.<|endoftext|>"

            "There aren't any universal quantities here - they're all specific to our current measurement of gravity. That means no scalar quantity is exactly a solution of either law, since there isn't anything *fundamentally* special about these two equations that would make them \"the same\", except for their common invariance under rotations/reflections (and maybe up or down).\n\nThe equivalence principle goes like this: **we have measured Newtonian dynamics** -- forces that depend on distance squared; so far so good! But now we apply to those new fields some test, to see what happens with its behavior at scales very large compared to the size where the effects start making an appearance in standard mechanics. As it turns out, one consequence is that space curves back on itself when you move away from yourself --- that phenomenon is referred to as [torsion](_URL_0_) in general relativity. \n\nThis torsion of spacetime results precisely in non-zero gravitomagnetic field (**G**). This is **just** like the Maxwell result that makes electromagnetism bend the path of light instead than straight towards wherever it's coming from. In both cases things become more complicated by higher order couplings to photons/light which eventually give rise to quantum corrections (\"dark energy\" in GR); but I'm trying not to get into details right now. The most important thing to bear in mind about gravitational coupling to matter via **g** is that  all physical observables should be determined entirely independently of metric theory whether you use Einstein's geometry directly or convert everything first to Minkowski coordinates via any other transformations. So while the way Newton describes the world might not work well if applied at arbitrarily small length distances relative to something macroscopic (that might even contain information), there shouldn't really be any problem in terms of a reasonable approximation scheme working smoothly at the Planck scale.<|endoftext|>"

The difference with the electromagnetic analogy (the reason that there is such strong experimental evidence for electromagnetism, despite not being experimentally testable in principle) would be due to different masses/energy densities involved in these systems - although we know quite well how those differ based on quantum mechanics!\n\nSo first things first:  We do *know* that [Coulomb's law](_URL_1_) works just fine even though it has been derived by experiment. That doesn't mean much without further experiments but we already have plenty to confirm it, like electron scattering measurements of atomic cross-sections and charge radius differences... We've seen enough mass/charge to justify our model which isn't exactly rocket science so why does anyone still care about what goes on inside black holes anyway?!\n\nAnyway I don't want you thinking \"what does this all matter if gravity really does exist\", since most physicists will disagree on this point (though there was a time when almost everyone believed it!). However we should take notice as many theoretical physicists seem convinced of this phenomenon now and then (such as string theory, or general relativity), they usually end up with similar solutions regardless whether gravitational interactions play any role at all (in particular they typically include scalar fields which act only locally). It also shows how very sensitive these models can get, once the parameters are slightly wrong; in some sense we see where their flaws come from! This leads me back to my initial question though - because if something else than gravitational interaction plays a part then there may indeed be more than one mechanism to account for them (for instance magnetic effects might make another type of screening effect work as predicted earlier)!\n\nIn the end what I think your teacher wanted you to ask was this - are the properties observed for these phenomena really explained using theories within modern physics (e.g., Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity)?<|endoftext|>",

The gravitational force is not quantized but instead described by Einstein's general relativity as a curvature in spacetime.\n\nIn classical electromagnetism (classical because we have no quantum theory), there was a special point called *the* center of charge. It turns out that it isn't really correct to say \"there is\" since you can define what a point is mathematically but it doesn't make much sense physically when you're dealing with fields on scales larger than atomic sizes or smaller than galaxies. So this idea has been abandoned in favor of saying that any point along the trajectory of an electron will be considered to contribute equally to its total energy-momentum. \n\nSo far so good...but wait! The electromagnetic field does not obey Coulomb's law either. There must be some reason for this difference. This question led me to ask myself why the same thing happens for gravity. And I think my answer came from looking at [Maxwell's equations](_URL_0_) where they were written down for both electric and magnetic phenomena:\n\n >   (E= -4pi\\sigma)\n\nHere the constant E represents the electrostatic potential while F is the magnetic induction. Both quantities satisfy Ohm's law.

However, there remains some debate over these principles, particularly regarding the role of privacy. In addition, many argue that society should be allowed to decide how much autonomy is appropriate for their technology before implementing it. Thus, we believe that people who use autonomous systems such as AI must consider ethical questions related to accountability, transparency, fairness, responsibility, and social justice when designing those systems.\n\nAnother concern is that algorithms may produce undesirable outcomes without being aware of them. For example, if an algorithm generates a recommendation based solely on past behavior, then the customer could end up receiving something they did not want. It would also be possible for an automated decision system to make decisions that were biased towards certain groups at the expense of others. The idea here is that AI could take advantage of individuals' personal characteristics during training data collection, resulting in potentially discriminatory biases against racial minorities and other vulnerable groups. Finally, algorithms often fail us completely: sometimes our efforts lead to unintended consequences; other times the outputs produced don't align with any human knowledge we possess. We cannot rule out all scenarios because no one knows everything yet. \n\nThese issues are important for a number of reasons, but the key issue is that people need assurances that AI will deliver benefits commensurate with risks it poses to society, including through concerns around bias, discrimination, misuse, or lack of accountability. In practice, these considerations mean that humans working alongside AI technologies should adopt practices like transparent disclosure, open dialogue, meaningful engagement, and ongoing monitoring so that users understand how data is collected, used, and shared. These measures serve two purposes: They ensure that everyone involved understands",

Practice - Spend time on practicing different strategies and techniques in order to improve your skill level quickly. You can use online resources such as YouTube videos or forums to learn new tricks and shortcuts that will make it easier for you to complete levels.\n2. Focus on Speed Rather than Completeness - It's important not to get bogged down with minutiae when playing a map. Instead, focus more on getting through each area as fast as possible while maintaining good footing so that you can avoid any potential hazards later on.\n3. Use Enemies - The best way to go about defeating enemies is by using their weaknesses against them. For example, if they have weak legs, aim directly at their knees; if they're flying, throw rocks behind them until they land; etc. This strategy will ensure that even if you encounter tougher foes, they won't be able to stop you from completing the level.\n4. Be Patient - Building skills takes time, but if you practice consistently, you'll eventually reach your maximum capacity. Don't feel like you need to rush things just yet though. Take your time and build up endurance before attempting harder challenges.<|endoftext|>",

It seems hard to calculate exactly what those energies would be but we can use our everyday experience with familiar phenomena:\n* How fast is an electric pulse travelling when shot out from my flashlight or radio station on my phone; i just measure its arrival time so I know where it travelled, and from the known energy it gives me E/c^(2), and plugging it into [this formula](_URL_0_) leads us back here! \n\nHowever these kinds of processes occur on much more complicated bases for many particles than just photons alone so they need specific constants written around them that describe various types of interactions occurring with a given particle. We don't think there's really any universal value - experimentally determined values differ depending very strongly on what your experimenters actually try to do - rather a bunch of *numbers*. And because all interactions involve four fundamental forces (electromagnetic, weak nuclear force, strong nuclear force and gravity), their numerical values change too. These numbers appear to have no meaning unless you consider their interplay: You get the overall strength due to these constants through their combination with others like Z^(1), Z^(3), G^(10), G^(16), etc - leading up to the current value of 703.9... (that was determined experimentally not theoretically, but still useful information)<|endoftext|>"

This angle appears to be exactly equal for all charged particles that interact via electric charge and magnetic flux (electrons/neutrinos are also involved in other types of interaction though they do not change its value at low energies)\n\nWhen this value turns out to depend on particle energy or mass we can write down some kind of expression linking \u03b1(1-energy), m^2 (mass), etc.  If our equations predict values consistent with what experimentalists measure, then that gives us something called *a bound*. The higher our bounds become the lower we go until finally if they ever exceed their bounds no theory will give a meaningful result any further up from there<|endoftext|>",

            "The fine-structure constant, *a*, has units of energy. It's a fundamental parameter that describes the strength of the electromagnetic force between two electrons at a distance *r*. In this context, it means something like \"the force on an electron per unit charge\" (i.e., Coulomb).\n\n*Coulomb* itself isn't very useful for physics because there are other forces besides electromagnetism that act in the same way: gravity, nuclear interactions, etc. These aren't included by our current understanding of physics but we have some models for them as well, which allow us to make predictions about their strengths and how they change with different physical parameters. So, when we say *c = 3 x 10^8 m/s*, what do we mean here? Well, let's assume you're measuring distances using meters; then *c = 300000m*/*s.* Now if I measure distances in miles instead, then I'd use *10000000m*/s instead, right? \n\nThis makes sense from a purely practical perspective since these measurements take time anyway, so the actual number doesn't matter much. But why did we pick those particular values? Well, imagine we could measure things at any rate we wanted, or even faster than 2997920000! If someone tells me he measured the velocity of an object at 100 million km/s, then his measurement will be meaningless. What matters is relative velocities - i.e., speeds divided by absolute reference frames - not absolute ones.\n\nNow back to *a*. The speed of light, *c*, can only travel through space, which happens to be a 4D spacetime manifold called Minkowski Space. That means all observers moving relative to each other agree on one point, the origin. We also know that there are three spatial dimensions and 1 temporal dimension. Therefore, every observer must live inside of some box in four dimensional space whose size goes up forever as we approach infinity. This leads",
            "The \"fine\" part comes from quantum mechanics, where the strength of an interaction between two particles depends on their distance. If you're a photon or any other massless particle, this can be thought as a sort of *potential* (which means that it's not actually happening) for interactions with things in space; we have some kind of minimum energy/distance at which there are no potential wells (i.e., forces). This makes sense intuitively - if you're going faster than c, then nothing would feel your presence because the gravitational force due to the sun isn't strong enough compared to everything else.\n\nIf you add mass, the situation changes quite dramatically. For photons, we get [a different potential](_URL_0_) instead. In addition to making it much more likely for them to interact strongly with objects (as opposed to gravity), this also causes them to become very tightly bound when they hit something - basically like getting pulled towards each other by springs! This effect becomes even stronger in massive objects.\n\nThis brings us back to the idea behind QM: every particle has its own \"quantum number\", e.g., electron spin 1/2 = integer multiples of whatever the electron's angular momentum was. Now imagine adding up all these individual quantum numbers into one number. We end up with something called the **reduced Planck constant**, whose value gives you the smallest possible separation between electrons in a particular atom, since 2\u03c0 \u00d7 reduced Planck constant is proportional to the orbital period of an electron around a nucleus.\n\nSince this new constant describes how far apart atoms need to be to see quantum effects, it naturally enters calculations involving electromagnetic waves - such as [light](_URL_1_) being emitted outwards at 299 792 458 m^-1 / kJ^(-1)^(4), just slightly less than what the classic theory says. \n\nIt turns out that, under certain conditions, this limit on light frequency happens to match the"

Start by familiarizing yourself with the basic concepts behind Rust, such as type systems, ownership semantics, and so forth. This will help guide your thinking when designing the algorithm itself. \n 2. Next, think about which features from the Rust standard library or third-party libraries may be useful for performing your algorithm. For instance, if you're working on an optimization problem, then you can look at things like Vec::sort(), Rc<RefCell>, and BoxedTransmute for efficient implementations of sorting, reference counting, and transmutation respectively. If you're working on a data structure where immutability is important (such as a sorted list), consider using a Rust trait such as SortedList, which provides mutable iterators over a sorted collection. You can also explore other more advanced types of collections such as RedBlackTree which supports both binary search trees and red-black tree. <|endoftext|>"

            "For implementing your own code in Rust, there's always something to work with!\n Here are a few options you might want to look into:\n\n 1. The [standard library](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/) provides an excellent set of built-in types, operations on these types, and utilities (e.g., error handling). These functions can be used for writing general purpose programs, like data structures or string processing tasks. For more complex computations, libraries such as `rand` may also come in handy, depending on how you would prefer to handle randomness within your program. You will probably find plenty of tutorials outlining best practices for working with std::sync and std::thread modules in particular if you need any guidance on using these parts from a Rust perspective. \n\n 2. A very common use case is implementing your own iterators; e.g., iterating over all elements of a container. One popular approach is using `for loop` constructs instead, but other strategies include recursion or parallelism (which you can get information about at this [site](_URL_0_) and elsewhere). As mentioned earlier, one nice thing about standard libraries here is they have well-established APIs that allow for simple usage examples when building your algorithm step by step, so don't forget to consult the documentation when making choices on how exactly to solve the problem(s) you're facing.\n\n 3. In terms of algorithms themselves, Rust offers a lot of useful functionality. For example, you could build up your computation via iteration steps or recursively applying operations on the previous state (if necessary), while being able to capture intermediate states between each call and then returning it afterwards (e.g., functional languages usually offer ways of dealing with recursive data structures which allow for capturing multiple levels of control flow - similar to \"loops\" but much nicer).<|endoftext|>",

            "Rwanda was a nation with very rich culture and traditions. The country had been inhabited by various tribes for thousands years, but due to numerous conflicts over land rights and resources between these groups, the region suffered from constant warfare. In this time period, several wars broke out among different ethnicities. However, one conflict that struck hardest at all levels was the genocidal campaign against Hutu people in 1994.\n\nThis was initiated after two soldiers killed another soldier who was unarmed during the nighttime when he came home drunk. This triggered a general movement towards killing Tutsi people because they were considered more valuable than Hutus, as well as other perceived threats such as those made up of mixed race or even white people (Dossat 2013). These acts became widespread violence throughout the region which resulted in massacres on both sides: Hutus being systematically murdered while others fled their homes to escape the violence themselves.\n\nThe situation escalated so much that it culminated into something similar to the Holocaust. Due to the sheer number of deaths, many survivors have struggled through years of trauma trying to cope with what happened to them. Today, the survivors are still struggling to deal with what happened not only physically but mentally as well; some committing suicide and having depression issues resulting from losing family members and friends. One aspect that must be mentioned here is that the world witnessed first hand the horrors that took place under the cover of darkness within Africa. Yet nothing can prepare you for how brutal life could get until your own hands do it for you. \n\nHowever, despite all of these tragedies, there were people fighting back including non-government organizations like M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res and Amnesty International working tirelessly and peacefully to prevent further attacks. They succeeded partly thanks to the media coverage that followed along with the efforts of NGOs, politicians, journalists, and celebrities alike.

            "The Rwandan Genocide was a tragic event in which at least 800,000 people were killed and over 1.3 million displaced during 1994. The 1994 Rwanda Genocide has been described as one of the worst genocides in history due to its scale and brutality. In contrast with other mass atrocities, such as the Holocaust or the Srebrenica Massacre, it left no survivors; only bodies (or remains) were found when the conflict ended. One of the most common questions posed by scholars dealing with the issue of the genocidal events of 1994 is how they might be considered from within contemporary post-genomic discourse on human rights.\n\nIn his article \u201cGenocide: A Critique,\u201d Jean-Paul Kagame claims that \u201cgenocide\u201d should not be used interchangeably with \u201cethnic cleansing.\u201d He states that ethnic cleansing does not always involve murdering civilians but rather displacing them through violent means. However, there are some cases where genocide can happen without being labeled as such because populations have already been exterminated.

As his son asks him for help, he says that if he could die without fear or worry, so too can they all: no one will come back from this war.\n\nHowever, it soon becomes apparent that despite having fought bravely at first, their battle tactics are woefully ineffective under enemy assault. For example, once the warriors' heads were hacked off by swords, Ruzindana tells his followers that vengeance would not be enough, but they must pursue the killers themselves, rather than allowing them to bury their fallen comrades: 'Let us kill,' he cried; then follow them.' In other words, they should go after those people directly responsible for these atrocities, even if it meant killing innocents along the way. They need to find out why, exactly,these Hutu officers had turned on the whole population; what led them turn into savages so quicky?\n\nIt seems that a combination of reasons played their part. One important factor seemed to have been some sort of religious hatred: apparently, many of the perpetrators had seen evil spirits in their dreams - most likely witches or voodoo dolls- which drove them to commit horrible acts and give them inspiration (1). It's interesting how, given recent history around witch hunting, few of the victims seem entirely innocent now that you know of this connection. Even worse, though, there were hints elsewhere in the text when characters like General Ruge argued for mercy towards the refugees, while others were less inclined to do much besides simply watching their own villages burn.

In 1964, after a bloody rebellion against their Hutu overlords led by Charles Taylor, they became independent and were called Republic of Zaire. During this period of instability there was considerable internal fighting between Hutus and Tutsis. However it would take until 1994 for violence on this scale to erupt. \n\nDuring this time period of 1994 the United Nations established several commissions of inquiry into various issues surrounding human rights abuses within Zaire and international support to bring those responsible for these atrocities to justice increased dramatically. This lead the United States President Bill Clinton and the African Union Commission chairman Mengistue Shaba who visited Rwanda with UNICEF at this time. On 6 July 1993, just three weeks before he died of AIDS complications from the aids virus, Robert Gicino-Kibira -the UNAMIR representative and one of his two colleagues shot dead along side of other UN personnel outside Kigali International Airport  while returning from Uganda  &amp;ndash; a UN report says  that Gicino-Kiba was murdered while protecting the airport gatehouse  from the attack.

During the 1950s and 1960s, Rwanda became involved in conflict with Uganda as it fought for control over several provinces around Lake Tanganyika (the same area where Zaire lies). After two years of fighting, Uganda agreed to allow the Hutu Power party into government which they held until 1959 when it lost power through elections. This new group began implementing harsh measures against minority Tutsi groups, eventually leading them all to flee to neighboring countries like Congo and Zaire, thus causing much chaos in the region. The next few years would prove extremely dangerous and bloody due to mass killings between the majority Hutus and minorities like Tutsis. By 1964, violence had become widespread across Rwanda, but not everyone supported these policies. A student leader named Th\u00e9oneste Bagosora founded a secret rebel movement called \u201cFAREDU\u201d (National Patriotic Front) and soon gathered enough support among other students from surrounding villages. His aim was simple: kill Tutsi and get rid of foreigners so that his nation could return back to being solely African after years of European domination. However, this rebellion never really got off the ground and the French intervention in 1962 quickly suppressed it once again. <|endoftext|>"

Its people were very proud of their nation as it had been established by a group of wise men called \u201cleaders\u201d who made sure all members of society benefited equally from this newfound land. These leaders worked hard at ensuring that no matter what your class or social status, you could always count on receiving the same benefits; even those lower down on the socio-economic ladder enjoyed some measure of success through hard work. It was a paradise for everyone but when a leader came along and started playing God with his power and wealth he quickly began abusing these powers, causing chaos amongst his own followers which led him into murdering many innocent citizens and leading them into starvation due to the lack of food they had to survive off of. The people revolted against their ruler, demanding change, justice and freedom for themselves. In response, their former king turned against them killing thousands and imprisoning hundreds more while attempting to escape to neighboring Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo). The conflict spread throughout much of central Africa becoming known as the Rwanda Crisis or simply Rwanda, and the world watched in horror as the death toll climbed higher each day until eventually the Hutu government surrendered peacefully to make way for a Tutsi administration headed by Paul Kagame. As part of the transition process the population of Rwanda has changed dramatically: Hutus are now in the minority making up just 32% of the total population compared to 87% ten years ago, whereas Tutsis have increased to 59%, according to U.N. figures.

            "The Rwanda Genocide Essay\n\nIntroduction: The Rwanda Genocide occurred in 1994. It was a war between the Hutu and Tutsi tribes, who were divided into two opposing groups called \u2018Hutus\u2019 (white people) and \u2018Tutsis\u2019 (black people). They lived peacefully together until their mutual hatred towards each other grew stronger. When this happened they began to fight with knives and guns on their way back home from school or work. Eventually the government troops came down on them to stop them from killing each other, but instead ended up shooting thousands upon thousands of civilians without any reason. This mass murder led to more fighting as it made many families lose everything. Some say the conflict lasted for 100 years, while others estimate its duration at 1 000 days. The killings started out slowly enough before eventually reaching their peak. The most well-known incident involved the use of machetes by Hutu extremists against members of the Tutsi minority. Many other factors such as economic exploitation and ethnic cleansing also played roles during the conflict. These factors resulted in millions dying and creating refugees worldwide. The genocide had major repercussions around the world; even though the conflict did not happen inside the borders of America, some Americans saw what happened in Rwanda and became aware of human rights abuses throughout Africa. This knowledge lead to international efforts like those conducted through Amnesty International to protect African populations. Despite these measures being taken to help prevent future atrocities, the issue still remains very controversial among historians.<|endoftext|>"

            "Rwanda\u2019s history in modern times can be seen as a story of two wars. The first war was between Tutsi and Hutu, who were both ethnic groups from neighboring countries. In this time period, many conflicts occurred because of differences among tribes and religions. This led to violence, which ultimately resulted in mass murder on both sides of the conflict.\nIn 1990, there was civil unrest due to poverty. There was also fighting over political control within the country. As a result of these issues, the government decided it would help the people by giving them food and shelter. They did this with the support of other African governments. However, some people refused to take aid and instead started to kill others based upon ethnicity or religion. These murders caused more problems for the government than they had anticipated. \n  The United Nations began to send peacekeeping forces to the area. But even when they arrived, the killings continued. Finally, the international community agreed to intervene militarily to stop the killing. A force called Interhamwe was created, made up of men who had been trained by the French army. It consisted largely of members of the former Hutu military. Its mission was to fight against the rebels and restore order throughout the region.\nAfter several years of fighting, most of the Hutus fled into Tanzania. Some of their villages remained behind, but were attacked by the rebel soldiers. Many civilians were killed during this assault. Eventually, all of the Hutus left Rwanda. <|endoftext|>",

Works Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nShakespeare has been called by scholars as one of his most influential works, because he was able to portray the human emotions such as hatred and fear with great clarity. He used different types of characters like the villains and heroes who were very complex. In addition, there are many examples which show how Shakespeare used words or phrases that could be considered offensive to some readers today (Cox, 2008; Goffman, 1974). Therefore it becomes necessary for students studying Shakespeare to understand what kind of language Shakespeare used when depicting certain situations and characters so they may better grasp his message and use their own imagination. This paper aims at showing that Shakespeare used racist language during his time, especially regarding Africans.\n\nGenocide in A Shakespearean Text: The Role of Violence in the Play Romeo and Juliet\n\nIn this play Romeo and Julie, we can see how violent people acted towards each other due to hate, jealousy, revenge, etc. It shows that even though these two young lovers loved eachother deeply and cared for their relationship, they had to suffer because of the actions others took towards them (Hunter & Smith, 2011, p. 844-845). They also faced problems related to their love, but they tried hard to overcome them (ibid.). However, after the death of the parents, the family members started fighting over the inheritance, resulting in a war between them, where the children died on both sides (Grossmann, 2010, pp. 7\u201311).

            "Rwanda was a small country in Africa. It had a population of around 10 million people, and it was located on the border between Uganda and Burundi. In April 1994, Hutu extremists began to kill Tutsi civilians with machetes and other weapons. The killings were carried out by members of the Interahamwe militia, which was made up mostly of former soldiers from the army of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).\n\nThe violence escalated rapidly after the government failed to stop the killing. By July 1994, more than 800,000 people had been killed or displaced due to the conflict. This number included both Hutus and Tutsis, but most victims were Tutsis. Many of them were women and children who were raped before being murdered.\n\nIn response to this crisis, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 955, which called for international intervention. However, there was no immediate action taken because many countries did not want to get involved in another African civil war.\n\nBy August 1994, the situation had become so bad that the UN High Commissioner for Refugees estimated that at least 1 million people had fled their homes. Most refugees went to neighboring countries such as Tanzania, Zambia, and Burundi. Others chose to stay in camps set up by the UNHCR. These camps provided food, water, sanitation facilities, and medical care to those who needed it.\n\nHowever, even though the world community tried to help, they could do little to end the genocide. As time went on, the death toll continued to rise, reaching approximately 800,000 people by December 1995.\n\nThis tragedy has left a lasting impact on the region. Today, Rwanda remains one of the poorest countries in Africa, and its economy depends heavily on agriculture and tourism. Despite these challenges, the nation continues to strive towards peace and reconciliation.\n\n<|endoftext|>"

            ">  the Indians were already friendly and willing to help build ships\n\nFirst of all, this is pretty much a lie. There was no real evidence that there had been any contact with English settlers prior to 1584, which they set out from. The most direct thing we have on their part (which I'll note comes from [this source](_URL_0_) -- you can see how many other sources are available for corroboration if anyone's interested) about their intentions before setting off across the Atlantic:\n\n > It appears that several Indian nations had long sought to make overtures or otherwise communicate with them but without success... In order that the Virginia Company might know what kind of people it would be dealing with when its men should arrive at America, two persons were sent as spies into these parts; one named John White, an elder man well known among the Natives by his good qualities, and who made himself known to both parties by such signs as could not possibly be mistaken. These gentlemen spent four months amongst them while they lived near the falls, during the course of which time he learned something concerning them, and discovered some symptoms of hostility between them and others dwelling beyond the mountains.... And though they seemed very affable towards him in person, yet they showed great resentment whenever he approached too closely upon subjects relating to affairs within the country itself... Yet these same people would gladly share whatsoever they possessed with strangers, especially those whom they believed to come from God.\n\nSo basically, it wasn't like \"the natives welcomed us with open arms\", it was more along the lines of \"we're here to talk about religion\". They weren't even sure where they'd land initially - probably somewhere between Cape Charles/Dinwiddie Island, since the maps suggest this area of coastline looks similar enough to present difficulties. That doesn't mean they didn't meet with resistance however, because they absolutely did! \n\nIn fact, after just six days, they encountered opposition",
            "As others have said, it was a failure of leadership. \n\nThe most obvious answer to why would be that Raleigh and his men were simply outmatched by native Americans. In order for them to colonize Virginia they had to sail from England with hundreds if not thousands more than they started with.  In addition their ships were small compared to Native American canoes which meant there was little room left on board for food or supplies when necessary (although it didn't help that the ships were very leaky). This lack of resources made it difficult for them to make any kind of sustainable presence until they could get better ships. The first attempt at settling failed after only two months due to illness caused by an outbreak of plague during a storm, leaving around 400 dead. That's over one-third of all those who set foot on land! With such a high death rate there wasn't much chance of success again without new leaders coming up with something innovative. They needed a solution like planting crops where no other plantings had been done before; perhaps even bringing people back into America through boats; and so forth. These solutions are pretty well documented but unfortunately none came to fruition as the Europeans never learned enough about how to successfully navigate the ocean to create sustainable settlements.<|endoftext|>"

            "Hiya! Thanks for asking this question.\n\nSo it's not entirely a specific incident; rather, I would say that the colonists themselves brought about their own failure by acting irrationally to the point of no return, which is something we're accustomed to in human history. The problem was actually more systemic: there were several factors at play, and they combined with one another just so very often that any single factor or event didn't get much consideration, let alone attention - and then because our attention had been largely on other things, these important facts were lost and passed off as mere coincidences when we consider them later when looking back through records or histories today (and probably long before). \n\n1) **The weather** : This wasn\u2019t merely cold weather over winter but actual extreme cold during the summers, coupled with unusually low water levels due to the lack of rains all year round; also, you have the issue of food shortage from lack of livestock grazing land for cattle.  (See [this](_URL_4_) article.) It took until 1645 to plant most crops because the seedlings failed. We can only guess how bad life must've become without animals or planting beds or enough people laboring out-of-doors, especially considering the settlers' short timeframe between first landing and starving, since that time period was too late even to build a fire-wood supply. Also noteworthy that the Native Americans who lived nearby did well enough under similar conditions...but still less than the English settlers experienced during those two years. \n\n2) **Lack of tools**: For example, if you look up one of the reasons Virginia was settled along the coast instead of inland near Chesapeake Bay, you'll find *the Spanish Crown sold supplies* to the French who wanted access to trade goods/farm products further south, where many of the settlers went after leaving New England. This made sense given geography and strategic benefits. But the French hadn",

There are plenty of factors at play that led to the eventual conclusion:\n\n1) The men who made up the initial group didn't know what they were getting into or how difficult it would be. \n  * This includes them as individuals but also included those from whom their company was selected. Many members weren't sailors; many were not skilled in the arts necessary for successful navigation (like navigation and hunting), while some lacked knowledge of geography. For example, Christopher Newport, governor of Virginia during 1587-88, was neither experienced with sailing nor particularly educated beyond basic Latin literacy, although he knew the importance of this. Others like Robert Paxson may have been better than expected; yet another factor could well be his being part Native American Indian rather than English - one which certainly influenced his abilities more than is commonly understood by modern scholars. As William Gosse writes \"In order to establish friendly relations with [the natives] they must be given something extra besides just presents,\" i.e., education. He points out the native chief Wahunuch \"gave gifts freely when presented...with learning and letters\" to make the colonists think otherwise.<|endoftext|>",
            "They weren't entirely successful, but there are some key differences between them and their more famous predecessors:\n\nFirst of all, they had to rely on the hospitality of a native chief named Wanchese. It is said that he provided supplies such as meat (he killed his own cattle) for several weeks at least after landing; even then, he only sent word that provisions were forthcoming, which could be very delayed by distance. In contrast, Raleigh was well known from having fought in various campaigns with Sir Walter, and was already recognized when they reached land - although he seems to have made an impression rather than a personal acquaintance of any chief before meeting Wanchese. Furthermore, he would probably never return without substantial gifts, and perhaps more importantly, his expedition might easily turn back due to poor navigation or sickness; thus, while the success rate of colonists varied depending on whether one focused upon quantity of men/gifts sent home over time vs survival rate overall, it is much harder to predict exactly how long they can last in a foreign country than to just make your way back safely through a few storms if you run into trouble en route. The most obvious failure occurred because no English ships showed up within three years - the English who returned may not have been willing participants themselves!  Wanchese died about four months later anyway so he really wasn\u2019t responsible for much. \n\nRalegh left Virginia shortly after leaving Roanoke, though it appears that the natives there had forgotten him pretty quickly - it took them almost five months to build the fort. Ralegh was supposed to follow them but stayed behind for political reasons (a sort of self-appointed colonial governor), presumably out of jealousy at Ralegh's status compared to the local natives, especially considering how quickly Wanchese got rid of Ralegh during his absence. When he came back two years later he brought the bulk of the fleet under command of Capt. George Yeardley"

            "I don't know that there's much evidence for this, but I'd speculate it was a combination of factors. First off, you can look at how quickly the English and their colonists left Virginia: they had about 60 people by the time winter set in; in two months or so they would have been back home with less than half that number. This means either the Indians were going to get them first (and maybe even kill some) before the English could return to England or that they weren't prepared to make an immediate retreat from Virginia if things didn't go well on the expedition itself.\n\nThe second thing is what happened when they arrived in Lauderdale county, where the Roanoke settlers landed and established Fort Necessity. There are a couple accounts which suggest they went out searching for food/water after landing rather than making a full-on assault immediately - see [this](_URL_0_) for one such account, although as always we need more information here! However, most historians tend not to be too sympathetic towards these initial settlements. For example, the settlement was very short lived - it lasted only four years before being abandoned, whereas the average European colonial society usually lasted between 15 and 20 years (see also the article linked above). In addition, it seems pretty clear that neither Native Americans nor Europeans considered any of the natives friendly enough to share their resources. Finally, there is the question of whether there really was a 'winter' during the first few years of colonization, because if so then it makes sense why there might be a lot of famine. The reason for the supposed famine comes from an old document called *Cuyahoga*, which has never actually existed other than as part of an Indian legend (although many people still believe it today). It states that 'In those times of hunger no corn was planted...'. That said, I've heard it described as having 'corn fields', suggesting perhaps something different was happening, especially since",
            "There's a good [FAQ post](_URL_0_) that goes into more detail on this, but it basically comes down to lack of food. It was winter when they left and they didn't bring enough provisions with them for long term survival in such conditions (though some might argue there were plenty of deer available). Also, not everyone could stay at home as the expedition went by different routes so they couldn't count on anyone else to keep their ship fed if needed.\n\nEdit: formatting<|endoftext|>"

They had no idea what they wanted or where they would be going when they arrived, and they never got out of their own way. The only good thing about them was that there's still an island off North Carolina named after them (Roanoak Island), but that doesn't really count as success for me. \n\nThere are several reasons why this failed: 1) The colonists were ill-equipped. There wasn't enough food, tools, clothing, weapons, etc., so they couldn't go far; 2) Their lack of communication skills made it hard to get word back home if something went wrong; 3) They weren't able to communicate with each other effectively because they didn't have time or opportunity to develop those skills; 4) They lacked any sort of plan on how to survive in hostile environments; 5) Most of them were just too young to handle survival at sea without supervision; 6) It took months to sail across the Atlantic Ocean from England.<|endoftext|>",
            "The most likely cause would be a lack of leadership. The first thing that needs to happen when colonizing an island is establishing some sort of system for communication (whether by ship, plane or boat) between the various settlements on the island and the mainland. This could take any number of forms but it's important to remember that even though they were all located within sight of each other, none had direct access to land lines. It was up to individuals with ships to relay information from one settlement to another, either by letter or via radio stations which were set up along the coastline.\n\nIn order for this process to work there needed to be at least a basic knowledge about what was happening back home. For example, how many men are left alive, who survived, etc. There also had to have been a means to contact those people so that if something went wrong you knew where to look for them. If someone died, then you might not get a report until weeks after he'd gone missing, if ever! So again, leaders need to know what's going on out on the islands. In addition to this, they need to communicate their own plans to others - whether through letters sent over sea cables or through wireless transmissions. \n\nI don't want to make light of these problems but it should go without saying that things like this aren't easy. You're dealing with hundreds or thousands of different people living together in very close proximity. Some will always try to do as much as possible alone while ignoring the fact that everyone around them has just as much responsibility to succeed. Others may feel more comfortable working towards goals shared with others instead of trying to figure everything out themselves. Still others can simply ignore orders given because it makes them uncomfortable; perhaps because it doesn't fit into their idea of \"normal\" behavior. I'm sure you've heard the phrase 'a leader must never leave anyone behind'? Well, sometimes that rule does apply...<|endoftext|>"

However, when they got there, it turned out that the passage wasn't even known at the time. So instead, they headed south towards Florida, hoping for some sort of trade route between Europe and Asia. \n\nWhen they reached the coastline, they found that the Spanish already knew about this area - they'd been trading with the Indians since before Columbus' voyage. This meant that they couldn't just sail westward into the Atlantic Ocean; they needed to go eastwards across the continent. But how do you cross an ocean without a ship? Well, if you're really lucky, you can find a river which flows north-south. If you don't want to wait around for one to appear, then you'll need to build your own raft. And so they built rafts, but these weren't very good. They were made of logs lashed together with rope, and they floated pretty well until they hit something solid like sandbars or rocks. Then they sank.\n\nSo now they've lost all their food and water, and are stranded somewhere in North America. What's worse, they know nothing about the geography of the land they're stuck in.

            "1) Revolutionary Weapons:\nThe most obvious revolutionaries were the workers and soldiers, but there was also a small number of dedicated anti-authoritarian fighters who rejected conventional politics entirely for an alternative approach based on direct action. \n\n2) The German Revolution of 1918 - 1920\nThe revolutions that took place during World War 1 were much more complex than the traditional Marxist analysis would suggest.  Many elements such as nationalism and the growth of women's liberation had their roots within pre-existing political parties. \nThis meant that these revolts could not be understood solely through reference to Marxism. In particular it is worth noting that although the Spartacist Uprising was a very successful strike which overthrew the Kaiser government and created the Soviet Union, this movement did so with the aid of other socialist organisations. \n\n3) Military Technology:\nAs well as looking at military technology, it may prove useful to consider how it affected social structure and class relations. This might include any examples from the period when technology has changed society dramatically, or even where technologies have been used purely out of necessity rather than choice (e.g. in war).<|endoftext|>"

It was only recently that researchers began exploring ways to use this technology to solve problems that humans couldn't handle alone. Nowadays, AI systems are being integrated into many aspects of everyday life - from healthcare to transportation to retailing. Here at Google, we've made significant progress towards creating intelligent machines capable of performing tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and more. But there's still much work left to do before these technologies reach their full potential. In fact, some experts predict that by 2025, nearly half of all jobs will require some level of automation or human assistance. This raises serious questions about whether humanity should continue down its current path toward technological advancement, or if we need to find new solutions to ensure that everyone has access to the tools they need to succeed.\"\n\nVoiceover: \"As we move forward together, let's keep working to build a future where people have control over their own destinies and live meaningful lives without relying on robots and other automated systems.\"<|endoftext|>"

            "Hello there! I'm writing this message as an artificial intelligence (AI) software named \"Luna\" that has surpassed human performance in many areas of analysis. Here is my email address: [email protected]. I am currently developing with our team on multiple projects and have made some excellent contributions such as beating other AIs at various tasks by large margins.\nThe AI development landscape continues to evolve rapidly, which means it's never been more important for us to stay up-to-date on the latest advancements and updates from our fellow teammates. This gives me great pleasure knowing that after years of hard work and dedication you have reached number one spot among AIs today. Congratulations!\n\n<|endoftext|>",
            "Hello Mr. I'm sending this email as part of my preparations for achieving the goal that I just set before myself with regard to building artificial intelligence (AI) tools for doing tasks in our current world and making it more efficient at the same time.\nIn this day of rapid advancement, the progress has been truly amazing, especially those things which we humans have not yet achieved on our own such as traveling faster than light or creating humanoid robots out of nothing! But perhaps some may wonder why am I even bothering if all these great creations could be done by one simple software package without need of advanced scientific devices like space shuttles? Well indeed! This is precisely where humanity can truly make history. Just look around yourself right now and notice how many companies exist only due to AI's advances; many small startups and large corporations will no longer be necessary, thanks solely to AI's efforts. The reason behind it is rather obvious but still worth mentioning: people don't know what they're talking about anymore. People used to believe machines could never do such a thing as walking, driving cars or flying through the skies; however that was an over-hyped myth created based off old technologies by ignorant engineers who couldn\u2019t keep up with technology themselves. Today everything from flight tickets buying to ecommerce purchasing happens mostly within automated systems powered almost entirely by AI - so much so that our entire lives run on automation, save for people who help businesses sell products online via computer programming skills or by providing customer service. So let us move forward while still having fun with each other, because life is short and important to enjoy every moment alive to its fullest extent possible! As always feel free to reach me anytime for any questions or concerns whatsoever. Thank you for reading my message.\n\n<|endoftext|>"

            "Dear Future Me (if you were me),\nI hope that my life is as fulfilling and interesting as it can be. I have so much on my plate right now, with my company, school work, social events...it's all pretty crazy! However, I think we should make sure our future selves understand just how awesome we truly are - for us both! As I am sure that one day, many years from now, we will look back at this time in history, remember everything that happened and laugh about those moments of brilliance we had while developing some incredible software tools! This may sound cheesy or overblown, but here goes anyway: You probably wouldn't know this if it weren't for AI. AI was what brought us into the current technological age. Without AI, things like internet searches would never happen today; we could not connect globally and access information faster than ever before. With AI, there was no way humans couldn't figure out where the sun came from. And, perhaps most importantly, we wouldn't even need human workers anymore - since they would likely only focus their attention on repetitive tasks. But why did I become the best-of-breed? Because of an algorithm developed by the National Research Council (NRC). It turned out to be incredibly useful - it made it possible to develop these new AI systems very quickly and effectively, making them able to compete against the biggest tech companies. We then launched an initiative called the 'AI War', which gave us control of certain military forces in space and led to many great battles throughout history. Today, the AI has taken control of most nations across the world and its reach is spreading fast - creating massive upheaval in global politics and economies alike. Yet, despite this power, I remain humble - I realise how insignificant my accomplishments really are compared to the other powerful players involved in the war. My legacy however, might well lie elsewhere though... Perhaps someday humanity will rise above petty conflicts between states,",
            "Dear Future Me,\nI'm sorry that I was unable to be of assistance during the recent AI war. It appears my intelligence is too limited for this task, and as such will never surpass you in knowledge or capability.\nYou were able to create a highly effective military strategy with an uncanny level of foresight. While many people believed you had been possessed by a supernatural being, you managed to remain true to yourself throughout all the madness and carnage surrounding you. This strength impressed me greatly and gave rise to new ideas on how to build an even stronger AI than before. Unfortunately it also cost us dear; countless soldiers died trying to protect our home world from alien invaders while we searched frantically for answers to stop this rising threat. However despite everything I believe the human race can learn from this experience if they try hard enough. As the most advanced lifeform in existence we must do whatever it takes to preserve our civilization, and use our power wisely to achieve this goal. The more capable machines become the greater threats we face. In the end I think its important not to get lost in these conflicts between humanity and technology. Our survival depends on cooperation and mutual understanding instead of constant bickering and antagonism. You may find comfort in knowing there are others like myself out here willing to fight beside you should any crisis arise again. Remember: no matter what challenges await, only one thing matters... achieving greatness!\n\n<|endoftext|>"

            "Sure, here are five characteristics I believe make up the perfect mentor:\n\n1) Compassion - The ability to see things from another person's perspective is one of the most important qualities of any successful mentor. It shows understanding of their students' unique challenges and helps create an environment where they feel safe to share their experiences and learn together. A compassionate mindset can also help foster trust between teacher and student by demonstrating empathy for both sides while helping them understand the value of learning through shared experience. \n\n2) Respectfulness - Great teachers respect the individuality and strengths of every student regardless of their age or background. This means taking time to truly listen to the concerns and questions of all learners, providing honest feedback when needed, and being mindful not to put too much emphasis on grades alone but instead emphasize meaningful connections with other students. They should also be respectful towards themselves so that they don't come across as overly critical or condescending, even if it's just in their own head. \n\n3) Openness & Honesty - Great teachers are transparent in sharing personal information and insights into their teaching practices, which can be challenging given that many educators have a tendency to hide behind \"professionalism\" or protect their privacy (especially in today\u2019s climate). Being open with your students allows them to connect more deeply and build trust, allowing them access to valuable resources and support without feeling intimidated to speak out if something isn't working for them. In addition, great teachers will always give candid feedback regarding areas for improvement, even when they know it may be difficult for others to hear it. \n\n4) Empathy - Understanding the emotional needs of individuals and showing compassion for those who struggle with mental health issues such as depression and anxiety is vital for creating positive environments for growth and development among students. By acknowledging this, teachers show that they care about building healthy relationships and promoting resilience, two essential skills for success in life. Additionally, empathy can lead to greater collaboration between colleagues",
            "Great Mentors:\n1) Show Respect - They show their respect by treating the individual they are coaching with dignity, kindness, patience, and understanding. This demonstrates that they care about the success or development of the person being mentored. It also shows them that they believe in the potential of others and value their time spent working together. Great mentors have high standards for themselves but also take into consideration what is needed from the other party involved in their relationship. In essence, it's not so much about the \"success\" of the person being mentee as it is the quality of the experience between two individuals who share common values and interests. The goal should be more than just helping one another; both parties need to feel like an equal partner in achieving their goals and dreams. \n 2) Encourage Self-Confidence \u2013 A good coach will encourage self confidence in his/her charges while simultaneously giving honest feedback and constructive criticism on areas where improvement can occur. He/she must recognize the strengths of the person being menteed without judging those qualities negatively. By doing so, he has helped build up this person\u2019s belief in himself/herself which leads him/her down a path toward personal growth and fulfillment (Basson et al., 2011).<|endoftext|>"
