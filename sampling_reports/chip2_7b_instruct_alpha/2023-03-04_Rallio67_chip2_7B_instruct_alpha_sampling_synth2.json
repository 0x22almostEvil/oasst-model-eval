However, some modern theologians have argued that this interpretation cannot be applied literally because it requires us to believe that God is able to cause physical pain which is clearly impossible given our understanding of physics and biology. A more plausible explanation is that the text describes a form of psychological torture whereby God forces the Israelites into a state of \"spiritual exhaustion\" where they become so depressed and demoralized that they lose all hope of ever being saved again.<|endoftext|>"

It\u2019s important to note, however, that biases don\u2019t always work out well, so we must keep trying new approaches until we finally get something good!<|endoftext|>",

Make sure your video is properly coded and optimized with HTML5 tags to ensure that it can be embedded into a webpage or blog post. Additionally, upload videos at 240p (or higher) resolution to look their most beautiful.\n3. Try using related titles within each YouTube video description to encourage viewers to click through; add relevant and popular keywords and phrases from other sources as well as any industry lingoes which might relate directly.\n4. Posting regularly helps increase views, comments, subscriptions, and thus more potential customer base. It\u2019s also useful if the content posted matches what was requested for the topic discussed in the description field.\n5. Finally, use social media networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest etc., to promote the video since these platforms allow exposure to millions who may otherwise not see your work.<|endoftext|>"

            "\nIn general, it is believed that people have many different world views or perspectives due to their unique life experiences, social situations they find themselves in, etc., which can influence how individuals view things such as truth and morality. From a philosophical point of view, most scholars agree that there is no absolute truth; instead, humans must make decisions based upon personal beliefs about what constitutes \u201cthe good\u201d and \u201cthe bad.\u201d It has been argued that these values ultimately stem from one\u2019s own individual identity \u2013 a concept often referred to as \u201cworldview\u201d. In other words, although we may all hold similar core beliefs within our lives, we each develop them differently depending on where we come from and who we interact with. This means that two people living next door could both believe in God while seeing him very differently than someone who was raised Muslim but moved to America for college.<|endoftext|>",
            "\nThe world view of the individual is shaped by their cultural conditioning, which includes many influences such as family environment, personal experiences, educational background, religious views, social class, economic status and more. In order to understand how someone\u2019s worldview developed it is important to analyze all these factors and look at them through the eyes of the subject themselves. The most common types of worldviews that people tend to have can be broken down into two main categories; universalist or pluralistic. A universalist believes there is one truth that applies across cultures, societies and religions while a pluralistic sees different points of view existing side by side within society with little conflict between groups. It would seem logical then for any given individual to adopt a single point of view but this isn't always the case because each culture has its own unique values and beliefs. When looking at something like religion, although they may follow similar principles they often interpret those principles differently depending on their own life experience and value system. For example some people might find solace in Christianity while others might opt for Islam. Ultimately what ultimately shapes our outlook on things is our individual interpretation based on our own understanding of who we are and where we come from.<|endoftext|>"

            "\nPhilosophy is typically defined as study or speculation about knowledge, values, truth, beauty, goodness, and justice, with consideration given to how these can be used towards solving problems within a particular society or culture.  From this it follows that philosophy seeks to understand the deeper meanings behind various aspects of life such as ethics, religion, politics, economics, history and so much more.   To provide a philosophical explanation for a world view would necessarily involve delving into religious teachings which may also influence one\u2019s views in many other ways depending upon their spiritual leanings or lack thereof. Religious beliefs, customs and practices vary considerably amongst cultures and religions around the world but often they share common themes of morality, purpose, faith, love, loss, evil, death, judgment day, paradise or hell, reward or punishment, hope or despair, etc., all concepts woven together in some way through stories and myths \u2013 sometimes contradictory yet always deeply believed due to shared cultural heritage, personal experiences, exposure to outside influences or simply because everyone believes them in order to create meaning out of their own existence. In short, what makes up someone\u2019s worldview tends to become intertwined with the specific perspectives, beliefs and behaviors foundational to any given civilization or tribe; therefore no two philosophies could ever offer complete explanations without reference to at least some aspect(s) of religious dogma along with secular philosophical ideals.<|endoftext|>",

A philosopher would say much of this stems from a person harboring deeply held beliefs and experiences with which many find uncomfortable and inexplicable though possibly useful. Some may also feel there is nothing wrong with such mental baggage since life circumstances dictate where certain attitudes originate. Ultimately, a well composed description of why someone holds views and perspectives that do not coincide with what most consider'sensible' or conventional, should explain how their view makes complete sense despite being seemingly far outside normal parameters. A summary written in clear language must be included, supported through citations or reference to relevant sources to maintain proper academic integrity while maintaining succinctness and clarity.

The term world view can be defined simply as how one perceives reality through their lens; however PTA also refers specifically to beliefs or values that may underpin these perceptions, including ethical considerations, metaphysical positions, and religious teachings. While all human beings have a basic worldview, individuals develop different interpretations of this core perception due to experiences gained over time which then forms the basis for what they value and why they act within certain situations. As such, there are many varied worldviews that vary based upon factors such as gender, culture, ethnicity, class, etc., so when assessing a persons worldview it must be viewed holistically. It would seem clear, then, that people possess diverse personal world views even though most do share common ground.  2. From an ontological perspective, each individual possesses two primary categories\u2014physicality and non-material beingness, and a third category representing those who experience life both physically and metaphysically but don\u2019t consider themselves physicals because of lack of sensation, mental states like dreams and visions, spiritual encounters and communions with nature and deities. All humans inhabit three dimensions while simultaneously inhabiting some level of the four known to modern science: spacetime, matter and energy, space-time.3. Humans have long believed in higher powers and spiritual guides having access to supernatural abilities to affect events outside of their own physical existence, hence why people refer to gods as if divine entities rather than natural forces acting in mysterious ways throughout history. Some groups use magic rituals involving herbs and potions taken directly out of the soil and sky. These mystical practices provide believers comfort during hardships yet also draw attention to their unproven superstitions, thus causing tension between traditional religions versus more scientific belief systems. Believers often look at evidence selectively ignoring contrary evidence without necessarily accepting or rejecting its authenticity outright, depending on their current interests"

            "\n1. The first thing to understand when looking at some of the less well-known or obscure holidays and observances is that they tend to be deeply rooted in culture and tradition, rather than simply being \"religious\" holidays. So for example while Christmas might have religious roots (in terms of its origin), it's not exclusively so, and other countries celebrate their own versions of this holiday without necessarily having any kind of religion associated with them. 2  2 Other examples include Hindu Diwali which has strong spiritual connotations but also incorporates elements such as firework displays into the celebration. 3 In contrast, Jewish Passover may seem similar to Christian Easter, since both involve spring cleaning activities like egg hunts; however, there are subtle differences between the two including differing customs related to how bread is broken during the meal. 4  4 There are many more obscure holidays and observances still to explore! 5 Another way to look at these lesser-known days and ceremonies is to see if they serve as markers of important historical events or milestones throughout various civilizations' histories. 6 For instance, New Year\u2019s Day in China marks the start of a new year according to Chinese astrology \u2013 and this could mean anything from the beginning of an era, to a major shift in power dynamics within society. 7 This leads us back to the importance of understanding the underlying context and meaning of such rituals. 8 As a result, observing such traditions offers insight into diverse cultures across time and space.<|endoftext|>",
            "\n1. Ramadan \u2013 A holy month for Muslims during which they fast from dawn until sunset every day of the lunar calendar month (13th - 24th June). During this time, food and beverages like tea or coffee are prohibited throughout the entire month, except at specific times when breaking their fast is allowed. 2. Eid al-Fitr \u2013 The end of fasting period after Ramadan, also referred to as \"Festival of Breaking Fast\".3. Christmas Day \u2013 Celebrated in many countries across the globe, including the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Ireland, South Africa, Brazil, Mexico, Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Singapore, Hong Kong SAR China, Sri Lanka, Papua New Guinea, Pakistan, Malaysia, and Vietnam. 4. Diwali \u2013 Hindus celebrate this festival with much pomp and glory all over the country, especially in states such as Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, etc., where it is popularly known as Deepavali. 5. Kwanzaa \u2013 This African American holiday takes place annually on December 26th and includes nine principles centered around community, self-determination, collective work and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity, collective joy, love, faith, and unity. 6. Holidays Around the World \u2013 Other than the above mentioned major festivals, there exist countless other holidays and observances that take place in various parts of the world, such as Easter Monday in Scotland; St John's Eve in Cornwall, England; All Saints' Day in France; Children\u2019s Day in Croatia; and Labor Day in Japan. 7. Historical & Cultural Significance Behind Each Holiday \u2013 These days vary significantly depending on region, culture, religion, language, ethnicity, class, gender, age, etc. In some cases, the reasons for celebrating them may be related to historical events or beliefs that have since passed away.

It's important to remember that Einstein\u2019s theory of General Relativity was only a starting point in understanding gravitational force.\n2. To begin with, we need to look at what is actually meant when people talk about \u201cquantum gravity\u201d. There have been many different attempts to explain the idea behind this concept, from string theory to loop quantum gravity, but all these models remain highly speculative. However, one particular approach stands out for its potential success\u2014the holographic principle, which suggests that there may be a limit to how much information can be held within a given region of space-time.\n3. According to holography, if you take two regions of space separated by some distance d then the amount of energy contained inside each volume must scale linearly with their area. This means the more area there is between them, such as two volumes with a certain size d<<\\ell<<L (length), the less energy they contain. In other words, instead of having infinite amounts of energy spread evenly across any arbitrary space, the universe is like a record being played backwards; smaller spaces hold more energy because they have more records.<|endoftext|>",

It\u2019s always good advice to start small; break up the bigger problems into smaller pieces which can be tackled one at a time. The following principles should guide you when formulating solutions.\n1) Understand the problem thoroughly before proposing a strategy or approach.\n2) Choose appropriate methods and tools based on the type of task being solved.\n3) Identify potential obstacles and consider alternate routes if necessary.\n4) Make sure to use reliable sources whenever available.\n5) Be creative with ideas but avoid making wild guesses unless absolutely necessary.\n6) Always test new approaches against existing ones and keep track of progress along with any unexpected results.<|endoftext|>"

The Home Office said industrial disputes could not be resolved within the workplace but were issues which had to be dealt with outside work time or after hours meetings. In other words strikes may have consequences, including potential dismissals from public service jobs. Industrial tribunals have been given discretion to allow people to take legal advice before participating in such conflicts. But those decisions cannot override legitimate collective bargaining rights guaranteed under law, it added. It also rejected the idea that the union shop agreements already negotiated at many Public Sector Unions covered all employees when working through secondary action. So there\u2019s still plenty of flexibility available for employers to get rid of dissenters \u2013 even where both sides agree about essential matters.\n\n\n\nAlso interesting: I suspect some civil servants don't understand these complex processes either. https://t.co/FQzLrKX6Yk \u2014 Charles Arthur (@charlesarthur) April 23, 2018\n\n\n",

There\u2019s often times where programmers might wish to write custom vector types or perform arbitrary computations with arrays such as matrix multiplication, however doing these computations without any performance penalty can be quite challenging given how much memory they require, especially when trying to optimize over vectors/matrices, while still maintaining efficient storage costs. Here is some pythonic code to do scalar dot product between two vectors from a list of tuples.\n5. Many people know, having learned calculus at university years ago, that derivative functions represent the rate of change, of an unknown quantity being determined, by its original values. In short, the derivatives show us our future path according to history, i..e past states. As such, understanding basic calculus concepts remains extremely important, yet many would argue even essential to learning anything involving numerical work. The Python code below shows you how to calculate first n derivativties of an array `[1, 4, 9]` stored in list `",

In just 100 days (100 days), 800,000 people were killed at the hands of the regime and its militia; this was more than during the entire genocidal period in Bosnia or Cambodia. 2. As a result of the killings, hundreds of thousands fled their homes seeking refuge elsewhere. Many ended up being displaced again when the warring parties signed the Arusha Accords and returned them home only to have them targeted once more.3. The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda established the first international court to try individuals responsible for these atrocities but it soon became clear there would be no justice without access to adequate resources. 4. With so many victims and perpetrators remaining unaccounted for, some countries began pressuring Rwanda\u2019s government to cooperate with a United Nations peacekeeping mission, known as UNAMIR. Despite widespread criticism of what appeared to be procrastination, Kagame refused to budge until finally allowing a small number of UN troops inside the country on July 8th. This action allowed the world to see firsthand the horrific conditions left behind after the slaughter. 5. Since then, many countries and organizations around the globe have contributed humanitarian aid to those affected by the genocide. 6. But while the world has taken steps to ensure such crimes never happen again, other genocides continue to occur today. While not all governments play equal roles in stopping violence, global efforts can certainly make a difference. 7.

The event started with the slaughter of more than 800 000 Tutsi people in less than 100 days from April 6th through July 4th 1994 (Begashayita), leaving behind hundreds of thousands dead bodies and mutilated survivors who had no means of burying their deceased family members, but instead were left rotting along road sides. 3. The result was that Rwanda descended into chaos, civil war and political instability, leading to years of bloody conflict between Hutu majority and the minority Tutsi population until it came to an end in 2003 when the president Paul Kagame signed the Arusha Accords. 4. While the country has since managed to rebuild itself, many scars remain both physically and mentally, such as deep divisions within the nation's society and culture due to what can only be described as ethnic cleansing at best, or outright murderousness at worst. 5. Although not widely discussed during the crisis, one cannot forget that rape became another weapon used against women, children and men alike during these times, adding insult to injury, making victims even more vulnerable. 6. Violence and trauma have long lasting effects; the aftermath of the genocide saw widespread mental health problems among those affected, including post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, eating disorders and other self destructive behaviors. 7. As far back as 2000 there was a report from UNICEF that noted the psychological impact of the massacres, saying \"Children were forced to watch their parents being killed before their eyes. They lived every day in fear.\" 8. Today there still exists a huge amount of stigma surrounding talking openly about what happened during the genocide, so much so that the term 'genocide' remains taboo to",

Both World Wars have shaped military operations through such innovations as chemical and biological agents which transformed the ways forces fought one another (Wikipedia).\n2. Technology and Innovation Military technology has advanced with each war producing breakthroughs that forever altered combat effectiveness. Among these inventions is nuclear fission, jet aircraft, radar systems, and precision guided munitions. The technologies used during WWII had an almost infinite range\u2014from long-range artillery shells to tank guns capable of reaching targets nearly half way around the globe (BBC World Service).\n3. Strategic Planning While many technological advances led directly to Allied victory or at least prolonging it, equally important were other changes in strategy leading up to both conflicts. During WWI Germany adopted unrestricted submarine warfare against shipping and launched massive offensives against France Russia\u2019s allies; Britain's defense focused on Home Defence along coastlines and on home fronts where local civilians contributed substantially to morale. This gave German generals little time to reinforce troops from overseas theaters in order to achieve operational objectives. In contrast, during WWII Hitler's strategic approach was based upon territorial expansion but also capitalising on the vast resource potential found throughout conquered territories, including natural resources like oil and gas. Utilizing his newly acquired territory, he planned devastating bombing raids and attacks against non-belligerent nations before ultimately attacking Britain (National Archives USA).<|endoftext|>",

Tanks and armoured vehicles were introduced during WWI for close support operations. During WWII, these machines evolved into medium tanks capable of taking advantage of newly developed anti-tank tactics, and then eventually heavier armour plating and larger calibre guns to protect against enemy attacks.\n3. Radar was used effectively by all sides throughout the war to locate targets at night or in foggy conditions, giving aircraft and artillery a far greater range of attack options. 4. Advances in aerial photography led to improved accuracy over previously used maps that had relied heavily on estimates of troop locations.\n5. A wide variety of military communications systems have been used including wireless telegraphy, radiotelephone, telephone exchanges, teletypewriter, satellite communication and electronic messaging services. 6. As early as 1915, radio beacons enabled armies to coordinate movements more precisely than ever before, enabling faster and better coordination between different units, with less risk of miscommunication leading to failure in battle. 7. Air power proved essential during WWI when pilots could drop bombs from above to destroy ground positions while protecting themselves through effective defensive measures such as barrage balloons, which made them harder to hit without getting shot down first. 8. Aircraft design advanced significantly due to wartime needs; advances included increased performance (higher altitudes, higher speeds), improved weaponry and longer ranged capabilities, resulting in a much broader selection of aircraft available today.<|endoftext|>"

            "\n1. The humanoid robots and bots in use today aren't quite capable yet but there's hope that with time they'll become more lifelike. In particular we should mention Apple's Siri who has come leaps and bounds since she was introduced into public consciousness nearly 2 years ago (https://www.apple.com/ai-siri/). And it would be fair to say this AI system isn\u2019t perfect but is certainly much improved over where she started from just 3 months prior when released to general public!\n2. A related field that shows significant advances towards what seems like the distant future of autonomous robotics and automation involves the creation of machines that can think for themselves based purely upon neural networks \u2013 these \u2018Neuromorphic computers\u2019, so named because their computing elements mimic the function of biological neurons and synapses. There have been several advancements lately including new approaches for building these types of devices using nanotechnology. For example researchers at Cornell University have created a device called NeuRAID which stores data inside its memory cells made up of nanoparticles (https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/innovation/new-device-stores-data-inside-its-memorycells).\n3. One last interesting note worth mentioning regarding current state-of-the art Artificial Intelligence technology relates back to deep learning, which many people find difficult to understand despite all its popularity right now due to the fact it\u2019s an entirely different approach compared to previous forms such as Machine Learning. However recent advancements suggest it could lead to major breakthroughs especially when applied within a team environment and paired with powerful hardware and massive datasets (e.g. Google Brain Team, Facebook Robotic Process Automation Team).<|endoftext|>",
            "\n1. The internet has become so fast and convenient that it's hard not to feel overwhelmed by its possibilities! But what most people don't realize is that technology can be used in creative ways, such as through Artificial Intelligence (AI). For example, many applications like voice assistants, virtual personal assistants, machine learning algorithms, and facial recognition systems use deep neural networks which enable machines to learn from their environment. And these same technologies are helping us do more with less work than ever before - transforming businesses and lives every day. So this is one way that we've been able to change everything since we got here!\n2. There are plenty of resources available online where you could go look up \"artificial intelligence\" or watch some videos. It may take a while though if your goal is just to understand basic concepts without much hands-on experience. In general I recommend watching the first 10 minutes of the MIT lecture series at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwXftKf3R8YOv7j_Q6cUFvZSwdyM5mB&playnext=1. This should give an introduction to key ideas.\n3. Finally, let me ask you a question! How would you describe the impact of artificial intelligence on society?<|endoftext|>"

Also while the rewards aren't huge, my own progress feels very meaningful as long as I keep trying, although perhaps not as important to everyone as those above-mentioned things.
