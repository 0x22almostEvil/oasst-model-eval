In order for time to have monetary value it must either have intrinsic or extrinsic meaning which we already discussed. I would say that these two forms have been the most important and common ways that people see money related values. One example of this could be using an electronic banking account where time spent online has a monetary value associated with it. Another good analogy can be made through sports betting where one may spend their own time watching professional athletes compete against each other while putting their own finances down whether winning/losing in order to increase interest",

This extension overrides all fonts on web pages with the OpenDyslexic font, and formats pages to be more easily readable.\n\nYour brain can sometimes do funny things to letters. OpenDyslexic tries to help prevent some of these things from happening. Letters have heavy weighted bottoms to add a kind of \"gravity\" to each letter. You are able to quickly figure out which part of the letter is down because of this feature. It aids in recognizing the correct letter and sometimes helps to keep your brain from rotating them around. Consistently weighted bottoms can also help reinforce the line of text. The unique shapes of each letter can help prevent confusion through flipping and swapping.\"",

If your blade breaks during battle, then you could easily cut yourself using the remnants.

But yes there is some suspense at times when it looks like everything's going well but turns around again into turmoil. Overall enjoyable film! :-) And yeah Sarah Connor definitely needs better equipment...like that metal arm and gun she uses....hmmm maybe they could use something similar to what Bruce Willis wore during his first movie where he became John McClane? :-) Thank you so much Joi!

Statically-typed languages compile down your code to machine instructions before executing them. Dynamic languages instead interpret source code (often through an AST) at runtime. Each paradigm has advantages/disadvantages which should be considered before making your decision.\n\n",

You may also find it useful. \nHere below we go through common concepts and ideas that make programming interesting.\nCompilation/Interpretation: A compiler takes code or expression written in high level programming language(s) and translates them either directly (compiled programs) or indirectly (interpreted). Compile time is when your source code gets converted from symbolic form into binary object file. Interpreted compilation happens at run-time i.e., during execution stage.

As a second possibility, maybe there are several forces acting at once like there is electromagnetic force along with gravitional pull. If there are several types of interactions then there won't be any need to assign each type its own constant but still keep all together unified under one term while keeping clear what type of interaction was observed since we want to"

It could be an introduction or body section... well in fact both can make sense but let me focus first on finding good example using Shakespeare because this may give more insight for you. And yes I know how boring reading essays can be!! But if you'll trust me.. it wouldn't take long at all and will definitely provide useful insights on your topic, OK? Thank you :-)\n... done! All set! Now please type your sentence... ok... one moment... Okay"

Our focus is to teach agents how to learn from conversation flows. And our unique approach towards learning consists of preprocessing input streams using deep reinforcement networks; these can produce contextualized language models via recurrent neural network architectures, which allow us to derive natural language generation components out of them very efficiently. We also have training algorithms based around end-",

It is definitely going to change the way businesses communicate and interact. Well, speaking about communication and interaction - one thing which struck my attention while reading through was the way in which you guys were using the NLP techniques/knowledge-base behind our technology to solve different issues like sentiment analysis etc...\nWe have also read extensively over these blogs where you people provide interesting inputs towards various problem solving strategies(especially those related to Deep Learning). This clearly shows how much knowledge base has come together",
