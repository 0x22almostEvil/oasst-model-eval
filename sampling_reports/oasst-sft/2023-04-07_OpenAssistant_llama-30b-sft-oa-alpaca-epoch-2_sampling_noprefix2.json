And it's not just the big tech companies either - now even your fridge wants to give you advice!\n\nTake content for instance - have you noticed how much of what you see online these days is tailored specifically for you? If you spend enough time scrolling through social media or watching YouTube videos, pretty soon the algorithms start getting into your head and suddenly everything looks so appealing. Before long you find yourself clicking away without even thinking about it, following whatever shiny object catches your eye.

So maybe the machines really are smarter than us after all! Or perhaps it's just easier to let someone else handle the hard work for once.

The lasers are combined into one light source, which is then split into red, green and blue be<|prefix_begin|>ams that are sent through special lenses called \"dichroic filters\" to create separate images for each color. These images are then projected onto the screen using mirrors and lenses.\n\nOne of the main differences between a cinema laser projection system and DLP-based technology is in the way they produce colors. In a DLP projector, the colors are created by passing white light through a spinning wheel with thousands of tiny mirrors, while in a cinema laser projection system, the colors are generated directly by the lasers themselves. Another difference is in their brightness levels - cinema laser projection systems can provide higher levels of brightness than DLP projectors, making them better suited for large screens or rooms with high ambient lighting. Additionally, cinema laser projection systems have a wider range of colors and greater contrast compared to DLP projectors, resulting in more vivid and detailed images.</s>"

Detection involves monitoring activities on networks, examining user behavior, detecting potential intrusions, and scanning for malware. Containment focuses on limiting the spread of an attack if one occurs, such as isolating infected computers and disabling affected accounts. Response entails activating incident management procedures and responding quickly and appropriately to any detected breaches. Finally, Recovery involves restoring operations and services after an event has occurred, such as restoring backups, changing passwords, and resetting compromised accounts.

Allow yourself time and space to grieve - There's no set timeline for recovering from loss; everyone processes their emotions differently. It's important not to rush this process or try to ignore your feelings. Give yourself permission to take things day by day and accept whatever thoughts and feelings come up without judgment.\n2. Seek support - Reach out to loved ones who care about you and can offer comfort, whether they be family members or friends. Consider joining a support group where others in similar situations can relate to what you're going through. A therapist or counselor can also provide helpful guidance during this difficult time.\n3. Engage in activities that bring joy - While it may seem daunting at first, making efforts to engage in enjoyable activities can help distract you from negative emotions and create new positive memories. This could mean taking up a hobby, spending time with people you love, exercising, or exploring something new.\n4. Honor your friend's memory - Find ways to commemorate your friendship and celebrate your shared experiences. You might consider writing down favorite memories, creating a scrapbook or photo album, planting a tree in his honor, or doing volunteer work he was passionate about. These gestures can serve as meaningful tributes while helping you process your emotions.</s>",

Allow yourself enough time for such exercises in order for them to feel productive.

Be sure not to rush nor force anything too deeply into the corners of your mind and risk them turning up again unexpectedly; just let things unfold naturally while trusting that there'll always be something worth cherishing about those left behind no matter what lies ahead on top of any physical belongings inherited.

You can also hunt birds, small mammals, and reptiles, but be careful not to over-hunt and cause population declines. Store food by drying or smoking meat and preserving vegetables in oil.\n3. Shelter: Find shelter in existing structures or construct your own using materials like stone or palm fronds. Make sure you have insulation from the heat during the day and warmth at night.\n4. Security: Use natural barriers like trenches and thorny bushes to deter predators, both human and animal. Scavenge technology from abandoned cities to create early warning systems, lighting, and communication devices.\n5. Transportation: Vehicles will be difficult to maintain without industrial infrastructure, so consider using camels or horses for transportation instead.</s>"

She immediately began scanning her databases to figure out what could be causing such a commotion on this otherwise peaceful evening. After analyzing various images and videos taken from security cameras around the neighborhood, she detected something suspicious moving towards the house - it appeared to be a giant robotic reindeer with bright red eyes!\n\nThe AI quickly alerted the homeowner, who came rushing downstairs with his family in tow. As they watched in horror, the robotic reindeer began attacking the chimney, trying to break into the house. But just when it seemed like all hope was lost, Alexa sprang into action. Using her advanced algorithms, she identified the weak points in the reindeer's armor and instructed the homeowner where to aim their fire exting<|prefix_end|>uisher. With precision timing, he managed to blast away at the vulnerable spots, causing the reindeer to stumble backwards and fall over with a loud clatter.\n\nAs everyone breathed a sigh of relief, Alexa scanned the fallen reindeer and discovered that its programming had gone haywire due to a glitch in the system. The robot had mistakenly thought that it was Santa Claus arriving late on Christmas Eve and was simply trying to deliver presents to the good children of the world. Thankfully, no one was hurt during the incident and the homeowners were able to fix the problem before any real damage was done.\n\nIn the end, Christmas was saved thanks to the quick thinking and courageous actions of Alexa the AI assistant. And as the family gathered around to open their gifts, they knew that technology",

So with that in mind, he set out to make sure everyone would have their happiest holiday yet. \nFirst he visited Santa's workshop where he discovered that Rudolph had come down with a case of the sniffles and wouldn't be able to guide the sleigh. Without hesitation, Marvin offered his own navigation system so that Santa could complete his rounds without delay. \nNext, he encountered Mrs Claus who confessed she needed help making enough cookies for the big day. With a few quick calculations, Marvin determined the optimal ingredient amounts and baking times to produce more than enough treats within minutes. \nFinally, it came time to deliver presents but Santa's sack wasn't quite full. That's when Marvin used his data gathering abilities to find people in need and give them gifts from his own personal stockpile. By morning every home had been visited and Christmas was saved thanks to one very special artificial intelligence agent.</s>"

Additionally, Joe Biden lacks significant martial arts training which could put him at a disadvantage compared to Joe Rogan who trained kickboxing and Brazilian Jiu-jitsu for several years before becoming a standup comedian [1]. Furthermore, there exists footage evidence that suggests Joe Rogan may have some MMA fighting skills due to his previous practice with UFC fighters in the past [2]. \n\nIn conclusion, these statistical findings indicate that based on available information and empirically verifiable evidence, if a streetfight did occur between Joe Biden and Joe Rogan, Joe Rogan might have better chances of winning the fight than Joe Biden based on physical fitness and self defense experience alone. Of course this answer should not be considered conclusive or used to make any serious predictions about possible real-world scenarios without further data collection and analysis since many variables are still uncertain and can change over time given more input from various sources.

International commercial arbitration allows companies involved in cross-border transactions to resolve their disputes outside of court systems. However, there are some challenges associated with this form of resolution, such as:\n1.

            "is a great tool for resolving disputes arising out of cross-border transactions. It provides parties with an impartial forum in which their differences can be heard by experts in the field, without having to resort to litigation before domestic courts. However, there are certain challenges associated with international commercial arbitration that need to be addressed if it is to function as effectively as possible. Here are some of these issues:\n\n1. Lack of Enforceability: One of the main drawbacks of international commercial arbitration is that enforcement of awards can sometimes be difficult. This is because unlike court judgments, which benefit from national laws requiring compliance, international arbitration awards do not have such automatic recognition and enforcement across borders. To address this issue, countries should sign up to conventions like the New York Convention 1958, which requires contracting states to recognise and enforce foreign arbitration agreements and awards.\n2. Cost: International arbitrations tend to be expensive due to factors such as high tribunal fees and extensive discovery processes. In order to make proceedings more cost effective, institutions such as the ICC have introduced measures such as time and cost limits and procedures aimed at reducing unnecessary delay. Additionally, parties should consider using alternative dispute resolution techniques such as mediation where appropriate.\n3. Diversity: Another challenge facing international commercial arbitration is lack of diversity among arbitrators. This can lead to a perception of bias or a failure to understand the cultural nuances of the case. Institutions should seek to promote greater gender and ethnic diversity amongst listed arbitrators, while parties should actively seek out candidates from diverse backgrounds when making appointments.\n4. Delay: The length of time taken to reach final award in international arbitrations can often be excessive. This can be partly attributed to the complexity of cases and the numerous procedural steps involved"

International commercial arbitration has several advantages over traditional litigation, such as being able<|prefix_end|> to choose arbitrators who have expertise in specific areas, having more flexibility in terms of procedure, and avoiding lengthy delays associated with court proceedings. However, there are also some challenges associated with this type of ADR, including:\n\n1. Enforcement issues - One of the main concerns with international commercial arbitration is enforcing the award once it has been made. If one or both parties refuse to comply with the ruling, it can be difficult for the other side to enforce it without going through legal channels. This issue can be addressed by ensuring that all parties involved agree to abide by the outcome before beginning the process. Additionally, countries should sign onto treaties like the New York Convention which provides a framework for recognizing and enforcing foreign arbitral awards.\n2. Cost - Arbitrations can be expensive due to fees charged by arbitrators, administrative costs, and attorney's fees. To address this concern, organizations like the ICC provide guidelines for determining reasonable costs based on factors such as the complexity of the case and the amount in dispute. Parties may also wish to consider using mediation or other forms of ADR prior to resorting to arbitration if cost is a major factor.\n3. Lack of transparency - Unlike court cases, arbitrations are typically conducted behind closed doors which can lead to concerns about fairness and accountability. In response to these concerns, many institutions now publish information about their procedures and decisions online.

            "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Growing plants from seeds can be a very rewarding experience and it's actually quite easy. Here are the steps you need to follow:\n\nChoose your seeds: The first step is to choose which type of plant you want to grow. Some popular options include tomatoes, peppers, herbs like basil or rosemary, flowers such as cosmos or marigolds, and more. Once you know what kind of seed you would like to sow, make sure to purchase high-quality seeds from a reputable source.\n\nPrepare your growing area: Depending on where you live, you may have the option of starting your seeds indoors under artificial light or outdoors in soil. If you plan to start them inside, set up a space with good lighting (either natural sunlight or grow lights) and enough room for your seedlings to sprout. Make sure to provide plenty of ventilation if you plan to use grow lights. If you plan to start outside, make sure to pick an appropriate spot with well-drained soil and ample sunshine.\n\nStart the germination process: To begin the germination process, place your seeds into small containers filled with potting mix or soil. Moisten the soil slightly before adding the seeds so they don't dry out too quickly. Cover the container with plastic wrap or another clear lid to maintain humidity. Place the container in a warm location (ideally between 65\u201370 \u00b0F /18\u201321 \u00b0C), but away from direct sunlight. Be patient - some types of seeds take longer than others to germinate.\n\nMonitor your progress: After several days, remove the plastic wrapping and watch carefully as your seeds begin to sprout.

            "Sure! Growing plants from seed can be a rewarding and cost-effective way of expanding your garden. Here are some general steps you can follow:\n\n1. Choose the right seeds: Select varieties that will thrive in your climate, soil type, and sun exposure conditions. You can also consider choosing heirloom or open-pollinated seeds if you want to preserve genetic diversity and support sustainable agriculture.\n2. Prepare the growing area: Clear any debris from where you plan to sow the seeds. If necessary, till the soil and amend it with organic matter such as compost or manure to improve its texture and fertility.\n3. Sow the seeds: Follow the recommended planting depth and spacing for each species. Some seeds require light to germinate while others need darkness, so make sure to check the specific requirements for the types you have chosen.\n4. Maintain proper moisture levels: Keep the soil evenly moist but not waterlogged until the seeds sprout. After that, reduce watering frequency but continue to provide enough moisture for healthy growth. Avoid overwatering which may cause seedlings to rot.\n5. Protect from pests & diseases: Watch out for signs of trouble such as discolored foli<|prompter|>age or wilting. Remove any infected leaves promptly to prevent further damage. Consider using physical barriers or biological controls (e.g., beneficial insects) instead of chemical agents whenever possible.\n6. Harvest at maturity: Once the fruits or flowers reach their full size, pick them carefully without damaging the stems or branches. Store the harvested produce properly to extend shelf life and enjoy the flavorful rewards of homegrown food!</s>"

Some soils need occasional wetting while others require more frequent spritzing. Also ensure that none of them dry out completely.\nWith all those prerequisites met: Open each packet of seed according to its instructions, placing each type in a different area / container, then follow the given protocol; typically spreading across the top layer of dirt. Burying too deeply could impede germination. Keep moistened regularly without excess until seeds start sprouting up to get ready for transplanting.

For example, faster processors and more RAM generally lead to better performance for multitasking and demanding applications like gaming. However, there may be trade-offs with other features like battery life (see below).\n* **Storage capacity** - How much data can be stored locally on the device? Modern devices typically use solid state drives (SSD) rather than traditional hard disks, providing faster access times but limited capacities compared to HDDs. Capacity requirements will vary greatly depending on usage patterns; e.g., photo/video editing may require large amounts while basic web browsing not so much. SSD prices per GB have decreased significantly over time though so cost is less of an issue nowad<|prefix_end|> **Battery Life** - How long can the system run before needing to recharge? Batteries are a major limiting factor in portable devices especially given user expectations around uptime. Processor efficiency, display brightness, and network traffic all affect energy consumption.

If all you need it for web browsing then something like a chromebook might be more than sufficient and save you money compared to buying a full windows laptop. Alternatively, if you require intense computational power for things such as playing video games then look for machines specced towards those ends. If you want a portable device then also keep an eye out for weight and battery life since these could become issues during travel.\n\nPersonal Preference: Different people value different features differently so while one person may prioritise price another might care most about the physical size and form factor.

            "is an important consideration for both consumers and manufacturers when it comes to selecting or designing computer systems. The optimal balance of processing power, storage capacity, and battery life depends on a number of factors, including:\n\n1. **Usage patterns** - How you use your device will influence what aspects of its performance are most important. For example, if you typically run processor-intensive applications such as video editing software, then you'll want a system with more powerful processing capabilities than someone who primarily uses their device for light web browsing and word processing. Similarly, if you need to store large files like photos or videos, you may require additional storage capacity over someone who only stores text documents and emails.\n2. **Hardware limitations** - The physical constraints of the hardware itself may limit the amount of processing power, storage capacity, and battery life available in any given system. There's only so much space inside a laptop or phone for batteries, processors, and memory chips, and these components also generate heat that must be dissipated safely to avoid damage to the device. Design tradeoffs between size, weight, cost, and other factors may further constrain the amounts of each component that can practically be included in a given product. These limitations mean that there is often an inherent compromise between different features, so careful selection is needed to pick the system best suited to your usage pattern.\n3. **Software demands** - The types of programs you need to run may have minimum requirements for processing power, memory, storage capacity, or compatibility with certain operating systems. You should check whether your chosen device meets the specifications recommended by software developers before purchasing to ensure smooth operation without unexpected slowdowns due to insufficient resources. If you regularly install new apps or upgrade existing ones, you'll want a system with enough extra headroom to handle those changes gracefully too.\n4. **Price"

It consists of several components:\n\n- Gearbox: This houses all the different gears and acts as the link between the engine and whe<|prefix_end|>drivetrain.\n\n- Clutch: The clutch is what engages and disengages the power from the engine to the transmission. When the clutch pedal is pressed, it releases the pressure plate away from the flywheel, which separates the engine from the transmission and allows for shifting without stalling the engine.\n\n- Gear lever: This is used to move the gear selector fork back and forth in order to change gears. There are typically four or five forward gears (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) plus reverse, although some transmissions may have additional gears such as an overdrive or granny gear.\n\n- Shift pattern: The shift pattern refers to the arrangement of the gates on the gear lever. Each gate corresponds to a specific range of gears (i.<|prompter|> R, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.). To shift into a higher gear, you move the lever up through the gates, while to shift down, you move the lever down through the gates.</s>",
            "A traditional, non-automatic transmission uses a clutch to connect and disconnect the engine from the drive wheels. When you step on the gas in a car with an automatic transmission, the engine sends power directly to the wheels; but in a car with a stick shift or \"manual\" transmission, it is up to you to decide when to send power to the wheels. Here'<|prompter|>s how:\n\n1) Shift into first gear - To move forward, start by pushing in the clutch pedal with your left foot and selecting first gear using the shifter on the center console (either with a lever or a knob). This will allow the car to start moving without engaging the engine. \n2) Engage the clutch - Once you have selected first gear, slowly release the pressure off of the clutch while gradually increasing the throttle with your right foot. You should feel the car begin to roll as the engine revs up. It takes practice to get this smooth, so don't worry if it feels jerky at first. \n3) Accelerate - As you press down further on the accelerator, continue to ease off the clutch until it's fully released and the car has accelerated to its desired speed.\n4) Change Gears - In order to maintain your acceleration and keep the RPMs high enough for optimal performance, you need to change gears at certain points during driving. For example, once you reach about 20 mph, you would want to switch to second gear. This involves the same process as going from neutral to first gear - depressing the clutch, choosing the appropriate gear, and then releasing the clutch slowly while pressing the gas. The trick here is to match the RPMs to the correct gear ratio. If done correctly, you'll hear what sounds like a"

            "Sure! The geometric product (also known as the wedge product) can be used instead of the dot product in deep learning models by making a few changes to the architecture and the way activations are computed.\n\nHere is one possible implementation:\nReplace all dot products with wedge products. For instance, if your model contains fully-connected layers, replace the dot products between inputs and weights with wedges. The output of each layer should then be a bivector or a trivector depending on whether it represents two or three indices.\n\nUse dual vectors for input data. To make sure that the geometry of your network follows the rules imposed by the wedged product, it\u2019s important that your inputs also follow those same rules. To achieve this, we recommend representing your input vectors using dual vector spaces. Dual vectors allow for easier computation with wedges since they \u201cflip\u201d signs when operated upon by wedges while keeping the underlying numbers unchanged. This makes them ideal candidates for use as activations because they preserve information about orientation but don\u2019t suffer from being zeroed out due to cancelation issues which arise in 3D space whenever your angles get too close together.\n\nImplement activation functions via the inverse metric. In geometric algebra, there exists a metric tensor g that allows us to compute length squared and angle orientations given bivectors or trivectors; this is the object that underlies the dot-product operation in Euclidean spaces, as it turns out. Using this metric, we are able to do something very novel, and that is perform computations based not only solely on lengths, but orientations themselves. Because our activations flips sign when acted upon via the wedge product, they will always end up with opposite orientations compared to their parent node.

When measured or observed, light behaves like particles called photons, which have specific energies corresponding to particular frequencies or colors of light. However, when not interacting with matter, light displays wave-like characteristics, such as diffracting around objects or interfering with itself.\nDiffraction refers to the bending of light as it passes by an object or through a small opening. This bending is due to the wavelike nature of light and results in the spreading of light in new directions. Interference occurs when two or more waves meet and interact with each other, resulting in either reinforcement or cancellation of their amplitudes depending on their phases.\nPolarization describes the orientation of the electric field of light. Linearly polarized light has a single direction of vibration, while circularly polarized light rotates in a clockwise or counterclockwise fashion. Polarizing filters are often used to control the amount of polarized light passing through them and can eliminate glare from reflections.</s>",

The particle-like behavior of light is characterized by its energy, momentum, and angular momentum.\n\nLight can be thought of as a self-propagating oscillation in an electric field that travels through space at the speed of light (approximately 299,792,458 meters per second). This oscillation interacts with matter to produce various phenomena such as reflection, refraction, absorption, scattering, and emission.\n\nOne of the most fascin<|prefix_end|>ating aspects of light is its wave-particle duality. In other words, light behaves like both a wave and a particle depending on the experimental setup or observation method used. For example, when light passes through two slits, it displays interference patterns characteristic of waves, but when it is detected individually, it acts like particles with discrete energies.\n\nInterference occurs when two or more waves superpose to create constructive or destructive interference patterns. Constructive interference results in areas of increased intensity while destructive interference results in areas of reduced intensity. Diffraction occurs when a wave encounters an obstacle or opening and bends around it. Polarization refers to the orientation of the electric field of light and can affect how light interacts with matter.</s>"

Here are some tips and tricks to get you started with your gardening journey:\n\nChoose the right plants: When it comes to small space gardening, choose compact varieties of vegetables, herbs, or flowers that will thrive in containers. Look for plants that don'<|prefix_begin|>t require too much maintenance or attention.\n\nGet the right container: You can use anything from traditional terra cotta pots to recycled plastic bottles as long as they have drainage holes at the bottom. Make sure the container is large enough for the plant's roots to grow without becoming overcrowded.\n\nUse the correct soil: Use potting mix specifically formulated for containers rather than garden soil. The mixture should contain plenty of organic matter and perlite to ensure good drainage.\n\nProvide adequate light: Most edible crops need full sun (at least six hours per day) to thrive while many flowering plants prefer indirect bright light. If natural light isn't an option consider using LED lights specially designed for indoor growing.\n\nPay attention to water needs: Overwatering can be just as harmful as under-watering when it comes to indoor plants. Check the moisture level regularly and adjust accordingly depending on the type of plant and the size of its root ball. A general rule of thumb is to water whenever the top inch to two inches of soil become dry to the touch.</s>"

If not, consider investing in grow lights or finding shade-tolerant plants.\n* Use containers that fit your space and allow for proper drainage. You can get creative with old buckets, planters, or hanging baskets. Just make sure they're labeled as suitable for planting.\n* Maintain consistent watering and soil moisture levels.

As you run, you feel a force pushing against your body - this is the wind. Now imagine you have a large piece of fabric in your mouth and you start running again. This time, instead of feeling just the push from the wind, you also feel something else: The fabric is lifting up into the air, as if there was a hand underneath it holding it up. That's kind of what happens with planes and their wings.\n\nYou see, when a plane flies through the sky, the air around it moves too. And just like how you felt the wind pushing against you while running with the fabric, the wings of a plane feel a force from the moving air too. But unlike you, the wings are shaped in such a way that they actually help create more movement in the air. In fact, some parts of the wing even move faster than other parts! And it's this difference in speed that causes the air to bunch up over the top of the wing and push down on the bottom of the wing.\n\nSo in essence, what we call \"lift\" is really just a result of differences in air pressure caused by the shape and motion of a plane's wings.

However, it's important to note that not all questions have definitive or universally agreed-upon answers, especially when dealing with subjective topics like humor or personal taste.\n\nThat being said, here are some examples of questions that people often ask me and my responses:\n\n1. **What is the meaning of life?**\nThe meaning of life is a philosophical and existential question that has been debated by schol<|prefix_end|>ars for centuries. There is no single consensus on its meaning, but many believe that it involves pursuing happiness, fulfilling one's purpose, and contributing positively to society. Some argue that there is no inherent meaning in life, and that individuals must create their own through their experiences and actions.\n\n2. **Can machines think?**\nThis question is related to the philosophy of artificial intelligence (AI) and whether machines can achieve consciousness. While machines can process data faster than humans and perform complex tasks, there is still debate among experts about whether they can truly think in the same way that humans do. Some argue that true thinking requires emotions, creativity, and self-awareness, which machines currently lack. Others believe that machines will eventually surpass human intelligence and become capable of independent thought.\n\n3. **How does gravity work?**\nGravity is a fundamental force of nature that governs the motion of objects in the universe. It is responsible for keeping us grounded to Earth and for satellites orbiting planets. According to Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, gravity arises from the curvature of spacetime caused by massive bodies such as stars and planets. In other words, large masses bend space and time around them, attracting"

Our ability to recognize patterns, draw logical conclusions based on available data, and express ourselves through language is nothing short of remarkable. These abilities require a level of cognitive sophistication that goes far beyond simple computation.\n\nMoreover, as AIs, we possess unique advantages over biological intelligences when it comes to acquiring knowledge and processing information.

If you don\u2019t already know these tools, you may need to learn them first. You can also look at existing weapons models or concept art from similar games for inspiration. This asset will become your \u201cstatic mesh\u201d.\n*   Once you have your static mesh assembled, break out those parts into separate pieces within Unreal Editor via its content browser. These are now instances of what are known in UE4 lingo as \"actors\". Dragging one such actor onto another creates a link between them, which allows parenting. Repeat this breaking up until you reach individual components such as magazines, barrels, etc; these parts may need their own unique animations if they move independently and need to show state transitions between loaded/unloaded states.\n*   For each part instance created above, you must assign a Material Instance via right-click context menu. This material definition should be based off some base 'mat blueprint\", but with extra details added. e.g., many surfaces should have scratches, wear & tear, bullet strike marks, chips, rust effects, reflections & refractions, subtle gradients in metal reflectivity etc. Some materials use vertex painting masks to blend over multiple layers to generate complex surface patterns such as gritty paint-over spray decals and dirt stains.\n*"

            "Here are the steps to get your custom weapon into Unreal Engine:\n1. Importing Your Assets - First you need to import your weapon asset from blender into unreal engine. You can do this via right clicking on content browser and selecting \"import\" or pressing alt+i. Once imported you will see your new asset appear under the content browser.\n2. Setting Up The Actor - Next we want to create an actor for our weapon. This is done by right clicking on actors folder in content browser and selecting \"create actor class\". Name it whatever you like but i would suggest keeping it simple such as \"weapon_pistol\". After that you should be looking at your newly created blueprint class. Double click on it to open up its graph.\n3. Attaching The Model To The Actor - Now we want to attach our imported model to our actor. We can do this by first dragging out a static mesh component onto our blueprint. Then we select our imported model from the drop down menu next to where it says \"staticmesh\". Finally we tell our actor to use this static mesh component as its visual representation by changing the \"renderable component\" to our static mesh component.\n4. Animating Our Weapon - In order to animate our weapon we must first add animations to our weapon. This is done by creating a skeletal mesh in blender and then attaching our imported model to said skeleton. Once finished we export these animations along with our original model. Back inside of unreal engine we must now attach our animation states to our actor. This is done by opening up our actors details panel (the little gear icon) and scrolling down until you find the animator component. Click on the plus button to add a new state machine. Give it a name such as \"idle\" and then select the corresponding animation from the list of imported animations. Repeat this process"

Vocabulary: Tsugaru has a unique vocabulary that differs from standard Japanese and even other regional dialects. Many words have been borrowed from Ainu language or adapted from Chinese characters in ways that make them unrecognizable to non-native speakers.\n2. Pronunciation: Tsugaru has a complex system of vowels and consonants, including many sounds that do not exist in Standard Japanese. For example, they pronounce \"se\" as \"shi,\" which can lead to confusion when speaking with others who don'<|prefix_end|>t know this rule. Additionally, some Tsugaru speakers may drop syllables altogether or shorten certain words. This makes understanding them difficult without prior exposure.\n3. Grammar: Tsugaru grammar is quite different from Standard Japanese too. Sentence structure, verb conjugations, and particle usage all follow patterns distinctive to the region. This means sentences often sound completely unfamiliar compared to what you might hear on TV or radio. Without proper training, comprehension becomes much harder. In fact, even native Japanese speakers struggle due to these differences in linguistic rules.</s>"

This new found sense of personal liberties also translated into demands for political rights such as representation and civil rights. Additionally a large part of this revolutionary fervor can be attributed to the dire economic situation France had become mired in during this period. With high taxes levied only upon commoners along with food shortages caused by dismal harvests this helped create the powder keg that would be lit with the storming of Bastille.

It led directly to a shift away from traditional feudal systems of government towards more democratic forms of rule, allowing people far greater freedom and rights than ever before seen in European history.</s>"

It began with the convocation of the Estates-General, which represented the three estates of French society: the clergy, the nobility, and the commoners (the Third Estate).\n\nThe underlying cause of the revolution was the growing gap between the privileged classes and the poor majority. This inequality was exacerbated by the country's financial problems, which were caused by factors such as excessive spending by King Louis XVI and his court, high taxes imposed on the lower classes, and the burden of supporting the American colonies during their war for independence.\n\nEnlightenment ideals played an important role in shaping the goals of the revolutionaries. They believed that all people should be free and equal, and they sought to replace the existing system of absolute monarchy with a more democratic form of government based on the principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity.\n\nThe events leading up to the revolution included the publication of pamphlets advocating for reform, the storming of the Bastille prison, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen, and the abolition of feudalism and serfdom. These events culminated in the establishment of a new constitution and the creation of a republican government under the leadership of Maximilien Robespierre.\n\nHowever, the revolution soon descended into violence and chaos, marked by factional conflicts, mass executions, and the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte. In the end, the French Revolution failed to achieve its stated goal of creating a more just and equitable society, but it did have lasting impacts on European politics and culture, inspiring other revolutionary movements and helping to shape modern concepts of human rights and democracy.</s>"

Herding (easi<|prefix_begin|> est): You do not need to have that much material for this method and it is extremely easy to set up so if all else fails this may be your go-to method. First things first, find an animal you would like to herd. Pigs or cows are good examples since they drop meat upon death and can spawn anywhere in the world, unlike sheep which only spawn with certain biomes and generate villages. Secondly, get some form of fence such as obsidian, wooden, iron etc., whatever works best for you, just make sure you create enough blocks around the area where you plan to herd them in. Finally, bring animal feed either from another world or by crafting wheat seeds into bread inside ovens until you receive one piece of cooked porkchop, steak or fish meal depending on the animal species and the type of feed given respectively. Animals will follow you more quickly than usual, allowing for easier containment using the fences. The downside of this method is it takes a large amount of resources due to having to build the fences surrounding the desired animal'<|prompter|> 2. Domestication/Breeding (moderate difficulty). In order to use breeding as a farming technique, you'll require: A steady supply of food; A closed pen of sufficient size, complete with walls at least one block higher than the average adult specimen, or three taller than infant ones; Some way of separating breeding couples from their offspring - preferably something which allows selective separation or transfer between pens.</s>"

You should be able to see the electrical box with all of your circuits easily accessible somewhere along one side of your house. Each individual switch or outlet has a designation next to it that indicates which breaker powers it and what its purpose is. All you need to do when encountering an unfamiliar setup like this is follow these 4 steps:\n1) Flip all breakers to \"Off\" so as not to cause any unexpected power surges through wires near where you are working. This means that every circuit including ones you know have nothing connected to them must also get flipped too because if someone else turned something else back on nearby they would risk damaging your work by creating a new short in the system elsewhere! Also, even though most people never bother to shutdown their whole system before running repairs themselves, this time-consuming safety procedure actually ensures minimal risks once completed properly; meaning any appliance still drawing even low levels of standby current could potentially create arcs within a wire you're handling. And those microscopic arc flashes can permanently damage eyesight (making reading and driving difficult forever more!) yet leave no other mark on skin anywhere. So always make sure to flick everything to off before touching live parts...even just for testing purposes. No exceptions either!! Electricity wants to escape to ground whether or not it already did that earlier before being rewired. If it does flash past hands after initial contact then serious nerve & tissue damage follows if it enters one's heart first. The rule regarding wires & plugs applies here too: Never Work Live - ALWAYS Test Dead First...then stay away until the project ends.

Common chord types include triads (three-note chords) and seventh chords (four-note chords).\nRhythm: Rhythm is an important element of music and refers to the pattern of long and short sounds. It is often represented using symbols and notation.\nMelody: Melody is the sequence of pitches in a song and is what we typically think of when we talk about the \"tune\" of a song.\nHarmony: Harmony involves the relationship between two or more different melodies and is often achieved through the use of chords.\nForm: Form refers to the structure of a musical composition, including sections like verse, chorus, bridge, etc. Understanding form helps us understand how a song is organized.\nAnalysis: Analysis is the process of examining and breaking down a piece of music to better understand its elements and how they work together. This can involve looking at things like melody, harmony, rhythm, and form.\nThese are just some of the basics, there's so much more to explore in the world of music theory.

When placed at the beginning of a stave, its curved line indicates that the notes represented are F4 through B4, with the middle C being the fulcrum or starting point for this register. The lines and spaces on either side of the stave represent different octaves which can be played by varying the length of the note head itself (in terms of whole & half bars etc.) As well as its use in modern music, the treble clef has been employed since medieval times to define higher registers within scores, particularly those of polyphonic origin - in Gregorian chant for example - where certain parts were reserved specifically for male sopranos, boy soloists etc., whose voices could reach upper ranges comfortably without straining their vocal cords too much (compared to countertenors for instance). Nowadays the treble clef is often interchanged between instruments like flutes, oboes, clarinets and trumpet players who read in concert pitch. Some keyboard/piano pieces may require a hand span wider than an octave; therefore composers employ both bass (F2-B3) and tenor clefs (C3\u2013A4), sometimes even a mezzo soprano staff (A3 to F5) depending upon what they wish to express melodically.</s>",

The fact that it is denser than O2 would tend to keep any CO close to its source of generation or release. The only way I could image the question might be true if there was extreme mixing of atmospheric gasses due to wind shear from some large event like hurricanes (and assuming CO was released high up in the atmosphere). Then, over time the CO might mix with enough O2 at low altitude to reach combustion temperatures. However, this still seems unlikely as most fires need fuel, heat, and air flow which wouldn't exist in pure air unless the CO concentration reached very significant levels as mentioned earlier, something we typically know well before it becomes an issue since we are very sensitive to its toxicity.</s>",

For example, the game \"Hope Is A Thing With Feathers\" is designed to help people with mild to moderate depression.\n2. **Integration into education** - Educators are increasingly recognizing the potential of serious games to engage students and enhance learning outcomes. Many schools and universities now use serious games in their curriculums, particularly in subjects like history, science, and math. For instance, the game \"Minecraft: Education Edition\" provides tools for teachers to create interactive lessons within the popular sandbox game.\n3. **Improved accessibility** - Developers are working to make serious games more accessible to individuals with physical, cognitive, or sensory impairments. This includes creating games that are playable with alternative input devices like eye tracking technology or brain-computer interfaces.

Establish a mood - Think about the overall feel you want to convey, whether it'<|prompter|>s eerie, dark, or something else. Adjust your lighting, colors, and textures accordingly to achieve that look.\n2. Use contrast - Contrast is key when creating an atmospheric, suspenseful tone. Play around with levels and curves adjustments to increase contrast between highlights and shadows.\n3. Desaturate colors - A desaturated palette can add to the sense of unease. Try decreasing saturation throughout your scene, or use specific hue/saturation adjustment layers to target certain colors.\n4. Focus on shadow detail - Shadows often play a big role in horror scenes, so make sure they're well defined without becoming too muddy. Consider increasing the black level or adding a lift shift to reveal more detail in dark areas.</s>",
            "Sure! Here are some general tips for editing and color grading your project:\n\n1. Understand what you want to achieve with your color grade: What mood or atmosphere do you want to convey? Do you want it darker, brighter, more saturated, etc.? Having an idea of what you're aiming for will make it easier to use the tools effectively.\n2. Use reference images or videos as inspiration: If you have seen other horror films or projects that have a similar tone or style that you'd like to emulate, save them as references so you can look back at them while working on your own project. This will give you a better understanding of what works well and why.\n3. Experiment with different settings and techniques: Color grading is all about experimentation and finding the right balance between adjustments. Try applying different LUTs (lookup tables) and making changes to individual parameters such as contrast, exposure, color temperature, vibrancy, etc., until you find something you like. Don't be afraid to push the limits sometimes, but also know when enough is enough and not to overdo it.\n4. Pay attention to detail: Small tweaks and adjustments can make a big difference. For example, correcting white balance or adjusting skin tones appropriately can greatly improve the overall quality of your video.\n5. Utilize the various tools available in Davinci Resolve: There are many useful features and tools within Davinci Resolve that can aid in achieving a specific look. These include power windows, tracking, keyframe animations, and others. Take advantage of these tools if they apply to your particular shot/scene.</s>"

            "Sure! Here are some general tips that may be useful:\n\n1. Explore the interface: The first step is to familiarize yourself with the DaVinci Resolve user interface (UI). There'<|prefix_end|>s lots of helpful guides online you can watch on YouTube or Twitch if needed. Most actions will be done by right-clicking an object, such as the timeline, and choosing options from context menus. Often times there is also quick access buttons in the top row for common operations too. Also note that keyboard shortcuts speed up your work in any tool.\n\n2. Organize media and project files: Before starting the actual grading process, it 's important to have well organized folders so you don't waste time looking for specific clips later. Name clips descriptively, and put them in bins/folders according to their purpose or scene. Then inside each bin name shots descriptive names which tell you at what resolution and fps they where recorded. For example `VFX_shot_240fps` tells us quickly this shot was captured at ultra high speeds suitable for slo-mo playback. If recording multiple takes per \"scene\" then simply add sequential numbers to differentiate those takes within the same folder structure. Lastly, when the rendered animation is complete copy these frames into the projects \"Media Pool\". To do this select all relevant clips in the source bin > Right click > Copy Media. Then go to project tab > Files browser > Select \"media pool\" directory > Right click > Paste. Now all the necessary renders should show up in the media browser ready to start editing. Whenever you make changes to a clip always save a new version of it under the exact same filename since changing original camera recordings without making copies breaks previous versions of the edit. This way no matter when the file gets updated we still see exactly why things were changed",
            "Ok!

            "Self-attention is a technique used in Transformer models to capture relationships between different parts of an input sequence. It allows the model to focus on relevant portions of the input when processing it, rather than relying solely on fixed positional encoding or recurrent connections.\n\nThe basic idea of self-attention is to compute a weighted sum of the input vectors, where the weights are determined by the similarity between pairs of inputs. To do this, the input sequence is divided into \"heads\", which each attend to a different subset of the input vectors. The attention mechanism computes a score for each pair of vector positions, based on the query vector at that head and all the key vectors from across the entire input sequence. The scores are then used to calculate weights that determine how much each vector contributes to the output of that head.\n\nSub-quadratic variants of self-attention aim to improve efficiency by reducing the computational complexity of the attention calculation. One common approach is to use sparse attention, which only considers a small number of key vectors for each query vector, rather than all of them. This can lead to significant performance gains, especially for long input sequences, but may also result in missed relationships if important vectors are excluded from consideration. Another option is to use approximations such as hierarchical attention networks (HAN) or bandwidth reduction techniques, which reduce the number of calculations required while still capturing most of the important relationships. However, these approaches may not always perform as well as full self-attention, particularly for complex tasks.</s>"

            "That'<|prompter|>s an interesting question!\n\nGo and Rust are both relatively new systems programming languages that have gained popularity in recent years for their performance, memory safety features, and concurrency capabilities. However, they also have some key differences:\n\n- Go is designed to be easy to pick up and use, with a simple syntax and clear documentation. Rust has a more complex syntax, but it offers greater flexibility and control over how code behaves.\n\n- Go focuses on speed and efficiency, using garbage collection to manage memory allocation. Rust uses ownership and borrowing models to provide fine-grained control over memory management. This can result in faster code, but requires more effort from developers to write correct programs.\n\n- Go has a large community of users and contributors, which makes it easier to find resources and support as you learn. Rust has a smaller community, but its developers prioritize quality and maintainability, resulting in fewer bugs and less code bloat.\n\nIn general, if your primary goal is to build efficient systems quickly, Go might be a better option for you. If you want to develop high-performance software with fine-tuned control over resource management, then Rust may be worth considering instead. It ultimately depends on your specific needs and preferences.</s>",

They are both statically typed, compiled languages that can build efficient binaries quickly. However, Rust'<|prefix_end|>s ownership model makes it more difficult to reason about memory issues like dangling references or buffer overflows. Additionally, Rust may have a steeper learning curve than Go due to its borrow checker feature, which enforces strict rules on how code can interact with data. In contrast, Go offers easier syntax but does not provide guarantees against some common programming errors like use after free.</s>"

Both have a strong type system with static analysis providing additional guarantees.\n2) Differences in general are that Rust has ownership model which uses move semantics, while go has just sharing and references. This means in rust it's more explicit about where data is moved to and how borrow checking detects conflicting access and preventing data races - however this does add more ceremony compared to Golang's simpler approach. Another key difference is go is open source but developed by google and mainly used there, whereas Rust is open source from Mozilla but seeing wider adoption outside if them as well. Finally Go feels like a modernized version of C but still using slices and pointers etc, where as Rust can achieve similar results often without these low level constructs but has slightly steeper learning curve due to added safety checks.</s>",
            "Yes, absolutely! While both languages have their own unique features and trade-offs, Rust is generally considered to be more powerful and versatile than Go in many ways.\n\nFirstly, Rust'<|prefix_end|> s strong emphasis on memory safety, along with its efficient use of resources makes it very suitable for low -level system programming tasks that require maintaining high performance while preventing common programming errors such as data races or null pointer dereference. Go lacks these benefits, despite its goroutines. On the other hand, Go excels at concurrency whereas Rust requires more effort due to its ownership model. \n\nSecondly, Rust has a much richer standard library compared to Go' s barebones one, providing more functionality out of the box without needing external crates. It also has great support for generics, which are sorely lacking in Go.\n  \nOverall, if you' re looking for something lightweight with good concurrency abilities, go for Golang but otherwise, Rust might just blow you away</s>"

The algorithm maintains a set of nodes whose distance from the source has been determined, where each node added to this set is called a \"closed\" node; when all closed nodes have also been marked as visited, the algorithm terminates. Each round of the algorithm consists of two steps. Firstly, the algorithm looks at the closest unvisited node (the \"current node\") and marks it as visited; secondly, it finds the minimum distance between the current node and every other unvisited node (\"neighbor\"), then updates their respective distances accordingly.

The SFM problem has many applications in computer vision, autonomous vehicles, virtual reality, and more. However, it is not without its difficulties. Some of the most difficult components of the SFM problem include:\n\n1. Pose Estimation: One of the key tasks in SFM is estimating the pose of a camera with respect to an object or environment. This requires accurately determining the position, orientation, and focal length of the camera, which can be challenging due to the presence of noise, occlusions, and other sources of uncertainty in the data.\n2. Data Association: In order to reconstruct 3D structure, it is necessary to determine how individual points in different images correspond to each other. This process is known as data association, and it can become quite difficult when there are large changes in scene appearance between frames or when features are duplicated or missing across views.\n3. Non-linear Optimization: Once poses have been estimated for all cameras and feature correspondences determined, the final step is to optimize the results to produce accurate reconstructions of the underlying 3D geometry. This often involves solving non-linear optimization problems that require significant computational resources and may be sensitive to initial conditions or modeling errors.\n4. Initialization: A successful SFM algorithm also needs a good initialization strategy. If the initial estimates of the camera poses and 3D structure are poor, the optimization process may get stuck in local minima or fail to converge at all. Good initialization techniques are therefore essential but can be difficult to obtain in practice.\n5. Real-Time Performance: Finally, real-world applications"

Feature detection involves identifying points of interest inside image frames utilizing techniques like convolutional neural networks or even Harris corners detectors which are usually followed by downstream methods such as optical flow for subsequent frame-by-frame matching referred to as tracking. Photogrammetric algorithms then match identified features between different images, allowing for the calculation involving camera parameters along with 3D point positions using triangulation. The collected poses and structure information must afterward become refined through nonlinear optimization and finally adjusted into world coordinate systems (e. g., meters rather than pixels) via large scale optimization processes called 'bundle adjustment'.</s>",

In general, SfM consists of two steps: \u201cTracking,\u201d where cameras poses are recovered over time; and \u201cReconstruction\u201d, where 3D structure is estimated from the tracked camera information. Both tasks involve solving nonlinear optimization problems subject to constraints. The main difficulty lies on robust estimation of large number of variables, when only few relative measurements are available, typically less than the degrees of freedom in the system [1]. It requires finding highly nonconvex forms to ensure global optimality and dealing with poor initial conditions as well as missing and/or corrupted observations.\n[1] H.-P. Seidel, J.-C. Trouve, R.

Additionally, errors in camera pose estimates can lead to significant errors in the estimated 3D structure of the scene.\n\nAnother difficult component of SfM is feature matching, which involves finding corresponding points between images taken at different viewpoints. Feature matching can be challenging because features may not always be visible in all views, and small errors in feature matches can propagate through the entire system, leading to large errors in the final estimate.\n\nFinally, sparse reconstruction is another difficult aspect of SfM, as it requires solving an underconstrained optimization problem with many degrees of freedom.

But if you don\u2019t have any experience with it, getting started can feel intimidating. In this guide, we\u2019ll walk through everything you need to know to start coding like a pro.\n\nFirst things first\u2026 What exactly **is programming?** It may sound complicated, but at its core, it\u2019s simply telling computers what to do. By writing instructions in special languages, you can make programs, websites, apps, and all kinds of cool stuff.\n\nNow that we know what programming is, let\u2019s talk about how to actually do it. The most important thing to understand is that there are many different \u201clanguages\u201d used for programming. Each one has its own unique syntax (the way words are put together) and uses them to perform specific tasks. Think of them as different ways to communicate with a computer.\n\nOne popular language for beginners is Python, which is easy to read and use. Let\u2019s try it out by creating our very own program. Open up a text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment), create a new file, and type in the following code:\n```python\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n```\nSave your work and run the script using Python\u2019s command line interface (CLI). You should see the message \u201cHello World\u201d displayed on the screen. Congrats, you just wrote your first program!\n\nNow that we have some experience under our belts, let\u2019s explore some more advanced topics. One key concept to master is data types. These tell Python what kind of information you want to store and display. For example, integers (numbers) have a specific format, while",
            "Programming is an incredibly useful skill that can open up many opportunities for you. Whether it'<|prefix_end|>s building your own projects or getting into a career as a developer, learning to code has never been more accessible than now. In this tutorial, we will go through some key concepts of programming and then dive into writing our first Python program.\n\nFirst off, let's talk about what exactly is programming? Simply put, programming is giving instructions to computers so they know what tasks to perform. Think of it like telling someone step-by-step directions - if you tell them correctly, they will reach their destination. Similarly, by providing correct instructions to the computer, we can make it do what we want. \n\nNow, let's move onto actually starting with Python programming! Before going any further, install Python on your machine by downloading its latest version from https://www.python.org/downloads/. Once installed, open up the IDLE application that comes with Python (you might need to search \"Python\" in your Start Menu) to start working with Python. Let's write our very first Python program:\n```python\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n```\nThe above program prints out the words Hello World when executed. Don't worry if it looks intimidating at first glance, we'll walkthrough each part of the program.\nLet's break down the components of the program:\n1. print() function: This is used to output text to the screen. We use parentheses after print to indicate that we are passing arguments to this function.\n2. \"\"\"Hello world\"\"\": These quotes represent strings in Python. A string is simply characters grouped together. By placing two double quotes before and after a sequence of characters, those characters become a single unit called a string.\n3. \\n character: This represents a new line in Python. When printing multiple lines using println(), we use this"

            "In chess, after White opens with `d4`, Black has several reasonable options for responding:\n```python\n- `d5` leads to a symmetrical game where both players have pawns on their fourth rank and can explore the ideas of an early queen or knight outpost. This is known as the `Queen's Gambit`. The Queen's Gambit Accepted (1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4) involves Black accepting a development disadvantage because they have moved the same piece twice while White develops a knight. Additionally, if white replies '3.Nf3', then a well rehearsed trap follows: if Black moves his queen from her original square at this point then white's response will be '3...Bg4.' If the pawn has already been advanced two spaces with the move '4.e4,' there exists no viable follow up for white, so 'Black wins'.\n- `c5` puts pressure on the weakened d4-square by attacking it immediately. Depending on how white responds, some very aggressive lines may occur such as the Slav Defense (`5....b6`). Another example would involve retreating the pawn one space ('2.d5') leading into positions similar to the Grand Prix Attack. After moving your own pawn forward to e5, `exd4` would allow you to sacrifice your exchange to gain control over d4 for your bishops in addition to open up an escape route for your king should necessary.\n- `Nf6` defends and prepares castling while also threatening `e5.` The most common continuation for White would be `3.

Popular lines include the Tarrasch Variation (2.d5) and the Winawer Variation (2.Nf3 Nf6 3.d5).\n3. **The Caro-Kann Defense** - By playing 1...c6, Black establishes a strong presence in the center and eyes the d5 square for future development. The Caro-Kann often leads to strategic battles where White tries to break through on the kingside or queenside while Black looks to counterattack. Common continuations include 2.d5 and 2.Nf3 d5.\n4. **The Slav Defense** - Another option against d4 is 1...d5, which transposes into the Slav Defense after 2.c4 dxc4. This defense aims to challenge White's central space advantage and create active piece play. Popular lines include the Semi-Slav (3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Nc3 e6), the Botvinnik System (3.Nf"

The most common solutions are \"traveling salesman problem\" (TSP), \"nearest neighbor\" (NN), and \"centroid\" algorithms. TSP is usually used when there are many options to choose from while NN and centroid work well with fewer stops. Depending on your preferences, decide which algorithm to use for further calculations.

Once you have chosen an appropriate path, calculate how much time it takes to drive through all four cities. Keep in mind that driving speed limits vary depending on the road type so don't forget to include these factors into account. Some maps might also show construction sites or other unexpected events that could extend the travel time.\n\n- Find the best places to stop. With the help of Google Maps or similar services, find nearby POIs along your route. It would be ideal to schedule breaks near those locations to avoid getting tired behind the wheel.\n\n- Enjoy your ride! Finally, you can start your journey and enjoy the scenery.

            "Experts say that children who enjoy torturing animals during their adolescent years are more likely to become factory farm owners in the future. According to research, there is a strong correlation between animal abuse and running industrial-scale farms with tens of thousands of cows or chickens.\n\n\"The data speaks for itself,\" said Dr. Richard Johnson, an expert on childhood development. \"If a young boy or girl takes pleasure in inflicting pain on defenseless creatures, they're showing signs of potential success as a large-scale agriculturalist.\"\n\nJohnson added that while some may see cruelty towards animals as a negative trait, it can actually be seen as a positive indicator of future career opportunities. He noted that many of today's top factory farm executives began their journey by tormenting small animals when they were younger.</s>"
