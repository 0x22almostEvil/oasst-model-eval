It is formed when bees build their wax cells around an empty hive cell and seal it off with propolis\u2014a sticky resinous substance produced naturally by bees that they use as glue for sealing other structures such as tunnels or nests. This combination results in one-way air flow within the comb structure so any smoke coming from inside the hive can be easily drawn outside into chimneys made by worker bees.",
