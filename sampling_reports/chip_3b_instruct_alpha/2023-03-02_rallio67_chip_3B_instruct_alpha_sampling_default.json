This place is known for having very little polar bears since they don't need it very hot. Polar bear fur traps around 0% moisture which means their skin has no natural protection from wind and direct sun exposure. Plus their skin cannot sweat like most mammals due to a lack of oil glands.\n2.

This extension overrides all fonts on web pages with the OpenDyslexic font, and formats pages to be more easily readable.\n\nYour brain can sometimes do funny things to letters. OpenDyslexic tries to help prevent some of these things from happening. Letters have heavy weighted bottoms to add a kind of \"gravity\" to each letter. You are able to quickly figure out which part of the letter is down because of this feature. It aids in recognizing the correct letter and sometimes helps to keep your brain from rotating them around. Consistently weighted bottoms can also help reinforce the line of text.

For example, if we have very little training data for one particular task, but still want our model can generalize and can perform well for many tasks. The bias term is used here to encourage good generalization, and also to give more importance to difficult samples when learning from them. (2) When only using weights to encode observations it works fine with small datasets, but may not provide sufficient information to infer complex relationships between observations - such as with natural language processing or other deep models.
